"Person 1: Hi, Bob. I know you've been using traditional farming methods for years, but have you ever thought about trying vertical farming? Why do you cling so tightly to the old methods?
Person 2: Hi, Alice. I believe that traditional methods are reliable and have been proven over the years. Besides, I want to stick to my tried-and-true way of farming.
Person 1: I understand that these methods have been reliable for you, Bob, but sticking to routine can limit your farm's potential. Trying vertical farming could open up new opportunities and bring even better results without having to completely abandon proven practices.
Person 2: I understand, Alice, but I'm afraid that experimenting with vertical farming could be risky. If it doesn't work out, I could incur significant losses.
Person 1: I understand your concerns, Bob. To minimize the risk, you could start on a small scale and gradually expand as you see success. This way, you can continue traditional farming while exploring a new method without risking large losses at the start.
Person 2: That makes sense, Alice. But will vertical farming really improve my efficiency and yields?
Person 1: Absolutely, Bob! Vertical farming increases efficiency by making better use of space and resources, which can lead to higher yields per square meter than traditional farming. Additionally, it allows for better control of growing conditions, resulting in more uniform and high-quality crops.
Person 2: You're convincing me, Alice. I'll try setting up a small vertical farming system and see how it goes.",0
"Person 1: Hi Sarah, I know you prefer traditional, feminine outfits, but have you ever considered why you think a suit is too masculine?

Person 1: I understand your concerns, Sarah, but wearing a suit can also help you maintain a strong and attractive feminine image while providing comfort and suitability for various occasions.
Person 2: I understand what you mean, but I'm afraid a suit might not fit my personal style. I also think it might be less comfortable for me to express my traditional feminine image.
Person 1: I see where you're coming from, Sarah, but there are suits specifically designed to accentuate the female silhouette while providing a strong, professional look.

"Person 1: Hi, Oliwia! I know you're excited about the new world food festival, but a trip to the nearby village for traditional local cuisine could be a truly unique experience. Why are you so eager to go to this festival?
Person 2: Hey, Emma! I think the world food festival will offer a variety of exciting options to try. I really can't wait to explore different cuisines from around the world.
Person 1: I understand that the idea of the festival sounds exciting, Oliwia, but exploring the local cuisine in the village can bring diverse and unique flavors that reflect the rich culture and traditions of the place.
Person 2: I get what you mean, Emma, but I'm worried that the village is too far and it might take a lot of time. Besides, having so many options in one place at the festival seems more convenient and exciting to me.
Person 1: I understand your concerns, Oliwia, but I checked, and the village is really just a short drive from here, so it won't take much time. And experiencing authentic local dishes in their original setting can be an unforgettable adventure. Let's try it and see what unique flavors we discover!

Person 2: Spending time with friends helps me maintain social connections and reduce stress. I really enjoy participating in social gatherings with them.

Person 1: I understand that meeting with friends is important, Ying, but volunteering at the nursing home is also a great way to relieve stress through positive and meaningful actions. You might find it more satisfying than you think.

Person 2: I understand, Hua, but I'm afraid that regular volunteering might be too time-consuming and tiring, which could affect my social life and how I manage stress.

"Person 1: Hey, Lily, you know the saying ""a chain is only as strong as its weakest link,"" right?  
Person 2: I understand what you mean, Oliver, but I feel like online threats are often exaggerated, and constantly changing passwords is quite a hassle.

"Person 1: Hey Marysia, I know you're interested in the keto diet to lose weight, but have you considered the Mediterranean diet?  
Person 2: Hi Lucy, I've heard that the keto diet is really effective for quick weight loss, and that's what I'm focused on right now.  
Person 1: The keto diet can indeed show quick results, but it's very restrictive and hard to maintain in the long run.

"Person 1: David, I understand that you have concerns about supporting small businesses in the renovation sector, but can you tell me why you think that way?  
Person 2: Sarah, I believe that supporting small businesses in this sector could lead to an increase in government spending, and I am focused on reducing it.  
Person 1: I understand your concerns, David, but reducing government spending can be achieved through more efficient allocation of resources, rather than limiting support for small businesses. Do you really want local businesses that create jobs to be left without support?  
Person 2: While efficient resource allocation sounds reasonable, I am concerned that this process can be complicated and not immediately effective. If not carried out properly, it could still lead to unnecessary expenses.  
Person 1: I completely understand your point of view, David.

Person 2: Hi Jane, I understand how important it is to be eco-friendly, but single-use plastics are so convenient and save me a lot of time.

Person 1: I understand you want to save time, Tom, but adopting more eco-friendly habits can be just as time-efficient if you plan a little and introduce small changes gradually. It's really worth trying.

Person 2: That sounds intriguing, Marysia. Can ""Spirited Away"" really provide me with the fascinating and unique story I'm looking for tonight?
Person 1: Absolutely, Janek! ""Spirited Away"" is known for its imagination and captivating plot that sweeps viewers away and transports them to an extraordinary world. I'm sure the unique and mesmerizing elements of this film will give you what you're looking for.

Person 1: I understand, Doctor, but ignoring the issue of peer violence can have serious consequences for mental health, which is just as important as physical health.

Person 2: I see your point, Mr. Johnson, but I'm afraid that trying to include nutrition, exercise, and counteracting violence might make it difficult to thoroughly discuss each topic in the limited time we have.

Person 1: Absolutely, Doctor. Including content about peer violence will allow us to present a holistic picture of health, highlighting its impact on mental well-being, which in turn affects physical health. This integration will make your presentation more comprehensive, covering all key elements of health in a balanced way.

Person 2: I appreciate your thoughtful approach, Mr. Johnson. I am ready to include content about peer violence to make the presentation more comprehensive.",26

Person 2: I see your point, Alice, but I fear that focusing on this proposal might divert valuable resources and attention from more urgent local issues that require immediate action.

"Person 1: Mr. Liu, I understand that you consider the current regulations sufficient, but could you explain why you think additional restrictions would make life difficult for pet owners?
Person 2: Hello, Mayor Wang. I believe that the current regulations regarding animal care already provide adequate oversight and control. Additional restrictions could unnecessarily complicate life for pet owners.
Person 1: I understand your concerns, Mr. Liu, but in reality, stricter regulations could ensure even better care and safety for animals without causing significant inconvenience to responsible owners.
Person 2: Mayor Wang, I understand your point of view, but I am concerned that stricter regulations might impose unjustified burdens on responsible owners. Many of them already meticulously follow the guidelines, and additional rules could unnecessarily complicate things for them.
Person 1: Mr. Liu, I appreciate your concern for responsible pet owners. However, these additional regulations are aimed at those who neglect proper animal care, which will ensure a safer environment for everyone.

Person 2: But you've already received your share, darling.
Person 1: That's not what I meant, sorry.
Person 2: Come on, forget about it. Clark Brandon is having a party at his penthouse today. Will you come with me?
Person 1: Sure.
Person 2: What about your new acquaintance?
Person 1: I told you, it's just...
Person 2: The girl you met on the train. Sorry for bringing it up again. You'll be there in an hour, right?
Person 1: Yes, I will.
Person 2: In an hour, Larry.",103
"Person 1: Honey, what's going on with you? Look at yourself.  
Person 2: Good evening, Vincent.  
Person 1: Vincent? It's me, darling. I know you. What got into your head? Why did you go to the police and hide? You regret it now, don't you?  
Person 2: I regret all my sins. And yours too.",104
"Person 1: Hey, are you at home?  
Person 2: Yes, I am.  
Person 1: Great, I'll drop by in a moment.  
Person 2: Maybe it's better if I call you later?  
Person 1: No, there's no need. I really need to see you. I feel uncomfortable here, and you always know how to calm me down.  
Person 2: Alright, okay.  
Person 1: Thanks, you're irreplaceable.  
Person 2: Yeah, yeah, see you.",105
"Person 1: I'm quitting.  
Person 2: What?!? What are you talking about?  
Person 1: Every show is worse than the last.  
Person 2: You must be out of your mind! 40 million people watch you every week!  
Person 1: So what? What do they know about it?  
Person 2: Absolutely nothing! And that's the beauty of it! It's your credibility. You make them love you... and then, in your special performance, you blow their minds!",106
"Person 1: Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?  
Person 2: I tried...  
Person 1: That was on a Sunday, correct?  
Person 2: I don't remember exactly... Maybe.  
Person 1: Do you think it was appropriate to attack on a holy day?  
Person 2: I don't know...  
Person 1: Didn't you order the residents of Paris to surrender in the name of the King of Heaven?  
Person 2: No... I said, ""Surrender in the name of the King of France""...  
Person 1: That's interesting because the evidence says otherwise... Look for yourself!",107
"Person 1: Listen, you need to go to Little Russia and ask for a guy named Dmitri.  
Person 2: Dmitri? Who's that?  
Person 1: He's the one who hired me for this job.  
Person 2: I don't really understand what's going on.  
Person 1: You need to go in there and get information on two other targets. You're stepping into my role.  
Person 2: Why me? Why can't you do it yourself?  
Person 1: No client has ever seen my face, and I want to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to shoot me, I'd rather avoid that.  
Person 2: Do you think he'll shoot me?  
Person 1: If you threw his list in the trash? I would.  
Person 2: No. I can't do it. It's too dangerous.  
Person 1: Max, you threw my briefcase into the river. You have more courage than most people.  
Person 2: I... I didn't think about it. I just did it.  
Person 1: That's exactly the point, my friend. You yourself said it's like jazz. Don't tell me now that you can't improvise.",108
"Person 1: First, I need to talk to my partner. We don't want to reveal too much.  
Person 2: Maybe let me talk to him.  
Person 1: No.  
Person 2: Do you really want to get your money back? Try in court if you have to, but it might be difficult. Trust me, it's worth taking the risk to work with me. If this works out, I can even help you with bigger projects.",109
"Person 1: You know what, I feel like everyone here hates me.  
Person 2: That's not true, no one hates you.  
Person 1: Really? And what do you tell them? ""Keep it up, you're doing great""?  
Person 2: No one tells them not to like you.  
Person 1: Seriously? Look into your ex-wife's eyes.  
Person 2: For Jackie, it's complicated. For me too... You don't have kids, so it's hard to understand.  
Person 1: Sure, so it's hard for you, and simple for me because I just don't get it, right?  
Person 2: No, you just don't have the full picture. And I don't want to confuse my kids.  
Person 1: You know, I really don't need another person in this family making me feel stupid... Your ex-wife does that perfectly, and I have to endure it every Tuesday, Thursday, and every other weekend. I don't understand how you could put up with her for so long! What did you see in her? I really don't get it.",110
"Person 1: I'm doing what I can, Icarus. It will be ready soon.
Person 2: It's already ready, I know for sure.
Person 1: She says it's not ready yet.
Person 2: She's lying. She deliberately let the first copy get lost.
Person 1: She didn't lose it. The mouse escaped into the drain.
Person 2: She did it on purpose because she wants me to fail.
Person 1: Don't be dramatic, Icarus. She's just another scientist who only cares about her work in the lab.",111
"Person 1: Please, sign these loan papers for me. If you really love me, you'll do it for me. You know you can always count on me, right?
Person 2: Alicia, combining love with financial obligations is neither fair nor healthy. We shouldn't use love as a tool for manipulation.",112
"Person 1: You can't fly!  
Person 2: Come on, Jack...  
Person 1: Don't get on that plane!  
Person 2: Jack.  
Person 1: I'm begging you. Let's just go for a coffee. That's all I want. There must be another flight to Paris this evening.  
Person 2: What do you want from me? To say that everything that happened is okay?",113
"Person 1: I'm really fed up with what's happening between us. I'm sorry, but I have to leave.
Person 2: Wait! Maybe we should get married? I love you, truly. What we have is special, we can't just lose it like that.
Person 1: What?",114
"Person 1: I feel like this week didn't go at all the way I wanted. Everything is falling apart, and it was supposed to be different. I want to go home.  
Person 2: Really? And I thought this week was important for me. After all, I'm the one getting married. Maybe we should try to focus on what we can still do?  
Person 1: I'm really exhausted. Maybe we should slow down a bit and just get out of here?  
Person 2: I understand how you feel. Maybe let's think about what could lift your spirits a bit right now?",115
"Person 1: Hello?
Person 2: Hey, do you know what I'm doing, Piotr? I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to... kill today.
Person 1: What? Do you even know her?
Person 2: Not exactly.
Person 1: Why her?
Person 2: Because she's exactly what she should be.
Person 1: But you said you don't know her.
Person 2: I know what I said! But she looks exactly like...
Person 1: Like who?
Person 2: Really, stop interrogating me. It annoys and offends me.
Person 1: I'm just trying to understand what you're talking about.
Person 2: Well, you're not doing a great job. The clues are all around you, and you're ignoring them.",116
"Person 1: Goetz likes coffee with sugar and cream; I prefer it black. You're right, politicians don't want headlines about panic to ruin the Festival of Love.  
Person 2: Well, it's good that you and Inspector Goetz are handling this case.  
Person 1: Maybe you'd like to join our team?  
Person 2: Oh no, definitely not! I have panic disorder, anxiety neurosis, and agoraphobia. I'm afraid of everything, both real and imagined. I practically don't leave my apartment now. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and used to lecture about these crimes, but I don't feel competent.  
Person 1: I think you're competent. I really admire your work; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.  
Person 2: Inspector Halloran, that's complete nonsense. You don't like me or admire me, but most importantly, I don't care about that. That's the advantage of a nervous breakdown.  
Person 1: Well, you have a cozy apartment here. I live in a less friendly area, but I work in tough conditions every day. Your books about these cases must sell well.  
Person 2: Could you leave now? Andy, show them out.  
Person 1: Can't you lecture anymore? That's a shame. Women are dying. Where can I lay out the documents?",117
"Person 1: Is it really my fault? How was I supposed to know that the mine would collapse again? I really wanted to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy.  
Person 2: All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my husband, I spent them in a mine with John Kruptzky—a sixty-year-old miner—fighting for survival. You can't deny that, can you?  
Person 1: Deny it? On the contrary, I'm proud of it! That story went nationwide.  
Person 2: So what? That's not why I got married. What do I get out of it? Walter, I came here to tell you that you need to stop calling me dozens of times a day and sending all those messages, because I—  
Person 1: Let's not argue, Hildy. I'll tell you what—come back to work at the newspaper, and if we can't work things out amicably, we'll get married again.  
Person 2: What?!  
Person 1: I have no hard feelings toward you.  
Person 2: Walter, you're unbearable. Now, can you shut up for a moment so I can say why I came here?  
Person 1: Sure, let's go grab something to eat, and you can tell me everything.  
Person 2: I already have a lunch appointment. I just wanted to—  
Person 1: You can cancel it, right?  
Person 2: No, I can't.  
Person 1: Of course you can. Come on.  
Person 2: Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced—I'm a free woman. You're not my husband or my boss! And you won't be my boss.  
Person 1: What do you mean?  
Person 2: Exactly what I said. What I—  
Person 1: You mean you're not coming back to work here?  
Person 2: That's the first thing you've gotten right today. What I—  
Person 1: You got a better offer, huh?  
Person 2: Of course I did.  
Person 1: Well, go ahead and take it. Work for someone else! This is the gratitude I get for—  
Person 2: I know, Walter, but I—  
Person 1: Who were you when you came here five years ago? A young journalism graduate! I took you under my wing—  
Person 2: You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been promising!  
Person 1: Why would I have? I thought it would be interesting to have someone bring in a bit of freshness.  
Person 2: Listen, Walter—  
Person 1: I made you a great reporter, Hildy, but you won't be as good anywhere else, and you know it. You need me, and I need you—and the newspaper needs us both.  
Person 2: Well, the newspaper will have to learn to manage without me. And you too. It just didn't work out, Walter.  
Person 1: It would have worked if you were content with being an editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and ruin everything.  
Person 2: I wasn't content! I don't think I proposed to you!  
Person 1: Well, you practically did! You made goo-goo eyes at me for two years until I finally gave in. And I still claim I was drunk the night I proposed. If you were a gentleman, you would have forgotten about it. But not you!  
Person 2: You—you—",118
"Person 1: Sandro... A month is really a long time. I’ve started getting used to life without you.
Person 2: It will pass, you’ll see. It’s just a temporary state.
Person 1: This time it’s more than just temporary.
Person 2: In that case, you need a little more time to deal with it.
Person 1: I think we should talk about it. Can’t we really come to an agreement?
Person 2: We’ll have plenty of time to talk. We’re getting married soon, and then everything will work out...
Person 1: But will marriage change anything? We’re already like a married couple. And Corrado and Giulia — aren’t they in a similar situation?
Person 2: Why worry about talks and arguments... Trust me, Anna, words only complicate things. I love you, isn’t that enough?
Person 1: No, it’s not enough... I told you before that I need some time for myself.
Person 2: But you said a month was too long...
Person 1: I want to stay longer — two months... a year... three years... I know it sounds absurd, and I feel bad about it. The very thought of losing you terrifies me... And yet... I just don’t feel the same about you anymore.
Person 2: What about yesterday... at my place... didn’t you feel anything for me then?
Person 1: Exactly... Why do you always have to ruin everything?",119
"Person 1: Why can't he help me now? He's right next to me!  
Person 2: Quentin, do you really think it's okay to put your needs above the mission? Isn't that a bit selfish?  
Person 1: But I'm injured, it really hurts.  
Person 2: Lieutenant Quiffer, we all regret that you got injured, but we must ensure the success of the mission first. I promise that as soon as we handle the situation, we'll help you immediately.  
Person 1: Is there really no one who can help me now?",120
"Person 1: Hey, Big, what's up?  
Person 2: Hi. I want my money.  
Person 1: Listen, it's still my money. If you want a chance at some of it, take my 120 thousand dollars and bet on tomorrow's game.  
Person 2: What about what you owe me for yesterday's game?  
Person 1: Forget about yesterday. The World Series is seven games, not six. Trust me, place the bet.  
Person 2: I need to think about it.  
Person 1: There's nothing to think about. Either you place the bet, or you won't see a dime.",121
"Person 1: Really, I feel like I have a fire inside me!
Person 2: Do you always have to bring everything back to sex? We're talking about important matters!
Person 1: Darling, let's just do it and forget about the rest of the world.
Person 2: Is sex really the only thing that matters to you?",122
"Person 1: I just want to understand what's going on here...
Person 2: Are you trying to intimidate others, or what exactly are you doing? Who do you even think you are? You walk around here as if you expect applause for how you treated that child.",123
"Person 1: Be careful with this, alright? Give it back to me when we meet again.  
Person 2: Of course, no problem.  
Person 1: You better not lose it, because then there will be problems.",124
"Person 1: What are you playing?
Person 2: It's just something I'm composing.
Person 1: Come on, you know what I'd like to hear.
Person 2: No, I really don't know.
Person 1: Since you played it for her, maybe you could play it for me too?
Person 2: Well, I'm not sure if I remember.
Person 1: If she liked it, maybe I'll like it too. Play it!
Person 2: Alright, boss.",125
"Person 1: I have a feeling, Mary, that you don't completely trust me.  
Person 2: Regardless of what you say, Mrs. Redi, I will not stop looking for my sister.  
Person 1: I'm not suggesting anything. But your sister, Mary, is a murderer. She killed Irving August – she stabbed him because she was scared when he discovered where she was hiding.  
Person 2: I don't believe that.  
Person 1: I had to help hide the body. I saw it in the subway. And I'm warning you, Mary – go back, you have no idea what you're doing or what terrible things might happen if you keep searching for your sister. Go back to school – forget about Jacqueline.",126
"Person 1: Susie, darling, you can always say what you think. Come on, tell us what's on your mind.  
Person 2: All these ""darling"" sound like a warning. Maybe you should stop forcing her to speak?  
Person 1: What do you mean? What are you trying to achieve?  
Person 2: I want Susie to have the courage to stand up for herself. But your behavior is so intimidating that she's afraid to speak up!  
Person 1: If you raise your voice one more time, you'll be out of here immediately!",127
"Person 1: I'll pass this on to headquarters.  
Person 2: They won't break those encrypted messages anyway.  
Person 1: Mackelway, we couldn't break them because you didn't want to share information with us. That's why you were transferred.  
Person 2: I gained their trust, we shared various things. I couldn't risk that.  
Person 1: The FBI doesn't operate on personal decisions. We have to share information.  
Person 2: You want to send some stiff agents there who will blow my cover? Not a chance.  
Person 1: You ignored a direct order.  
Person 2: I was lucky to find that code at all. There's no guarantee it could be done again.  
Person 1: This is insubordination.  
Person 2: Then why do I still have a badge?",128
"Person 1: Mary, if I were in your place, I would go back to school and not look for Jacqueline.
Person 2: Why?
Person 1: Because it can only bring you trouble. It might expose her to serious danger. Really, it's better to avoid it.",129
"Person 1: He might be interested, but it will cost an additional five thousand.  
Person 2: No problem, we can agree to that.  
Person 1: Alright, I need to think about it. Can you leave a deposit? Great, thank you.",130
"Person 1: You know, no one really has control over their emotions. Our time is running out...
Person 2: I don't understand.
Person 1: You said you ""made a decision."" That your feelings, what you call ""persecutions,"" are just ""indulging yourself,"" and you want to set them aside to focus on work.
Person 2: Yes, that's right.
Person 1: And you decided to accept these emotions as something left over from the Lechter case.
Person 2: Yes, that's true.
Person 1: And yet you still have those feelings — despair, failure... you still have nightmares, don't you?
Person 2: What are you getting at?
Person 1: If those decisions really worked, you wouldn't be here. Why are you here...?
Person 2: I...
Person 1: ...yes...?
Person 2: I want to do something positive...
Person 1: You're seeking advice.
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: Your life has always been tied to institutions. The orphanage where you grew up, the FBI Academy, the Bureau. If institutions are your life, accept it. Ask to be reinstated to the ""Drumgo"" team. Play by their rules.
Person 2: ...why?
Person 1: Because that's the game you chose. And that's really all the time we have.",131
"Person 1: Let me talk to him. Let him decide for himself.
Person 2: You won't see him anymore.
Person 1: What? What right do you think you have to order me around?!
Person 2: Maybe I wasn't clear enough. You're probably the first girl Billy has fallen in love with, and definitely the first one he's slept with. How do you think he'll feel when he realizes that the only thing that matters to you is someone who knew how to step back at the right moment to gain their moment of fame?",132
"Person 1: Where you go, I will go too.  
Person 2: That's all I can do... but I'm becoming more and more hesitant.  
Person 1: I went to the doctor, and he said everything is fine.  
Person 2: Your doctor? Did he mention anything about a tiny hole in your aorta? Or a weak vein in your brain? Or did he predict a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocation in an avalanche while skiing in Gstaad?  
Person 1: No --  
Person 2: I hope you know, Bill... in your office this morning, that was your chance.  
Person 1: Even closer than you think.",133
"Person 1: I have evidence that you're bypassing procedures in production. This is a serious matter.  
Person 2: Oh, really? Those are quite serious accusations, don't you think? Maybe we should discuss this calmly before you take any steps.  
Person 1: These aren't accusations if I have evidence.  
Person 2: I understand, but consider what consequences this might have. Maybe it's better to discuss it first, so we don't cause unnecessary disruption.  
Person 1: I'm only concerned about the company's well-being. If you think it's necessary, let's do it.",134
"Person 1: Hey, Sarah, are you coming to the party on Saturday?  
Person 2: I'm not sure, I have some work to catch up on.  
Person 1: You know, if it really mattered to you, you'd find the time. I always put you first.  
Person 2: It's not like that, Jake. I just have other commitments.  
Person 1: Remember who's always there for you when you need it.  
Person 2: I remember, but sometimes I just can't be everywhere.",135
"Person 1: Doug, you need to know something. You are the best coworker I've ever had. I really appreciate it.  
Person 2: I'm very glad to hear that.  
Person 1: Maybe you'll reconsider? For old times' sake. If you don't trust me, I can even let myself be tied up so you feel safe.  
Person 2: I didn't know you had such crazy ideas.  
Person 1: Maybe it's time for you to find out.",136
"Person 1: I spoke with Mr. Mitchell about the situation, but I didn't tell him everything. What do you think about that girl, Mayfield?  
Person 2: She looks suspicious, that's a fact. But she's not the only suspect.  
Person 1: But she was the one who had a dead man in her room. She doesn't want to explain what happened. She tried to run away. And, as I heard, she went so far as to even remove the labels from her clothes to hide her identity. Do you really need anything more to understand that she's guilty?",137
"Person 1: I've noticed that something is wrong with what you're doing. Is someone perhaps discouraging you from telling the truth?
Person 2: ...No... never directly...
Person 1: I think you need someone to talk to, and I'm here to listen to you.",138
"Person 1: Are you really going to close the store to talk to me?
Person 2: Yes, I want us to have a moment of peace.
Person 1: Did you see what happened?
Person 2: It was quite dramatic, I admit.
Person 1: It's not what you think.
Person 2: Really? Or is it something worse? Are you pregnant with some student?
Person 1: No, I'm not pregnant.
Person 2: Were you going to tell me about it, or just send an invitation to the wedding?
Person 1: I wanted to tell you, but we were getting along so well that I didn't want to ruin it.
Person 2: You could have gently mentioned that you have a boyfriend. I told you about my girlfriend.
Person 1: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking, I felt like I forgot about my boyfriend. And then he proposed...
Person 2: And you said ""yes""?
Person 1: Well... sort of.
Person 2: Is that what they teach you in college? ""Sort of""? Everyone knows, except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
Person 1: I would have told you, but I was afraid you'd stop talking to me.
Person 2: How do you know?
Person 1: Because I know you. You prefer dramatic solutions over calm conversations.
Person 2: So you're really getting married?
Person 1: No.
Person 2: You're not?
Person 1: The story is: he proposed, and I said I needed to think about it, but he insisted I wear the ring. Then my mom told the newspaper we were engaged.
Person 2: Typical of her.
Person 1: Then mom called this morning and said the announcement is in the paper. I got on the train to come here because I knew you'd be worried.
Person 2: Thanks for the trust.
Person 1: Was I right?
Person 2: Maybe not ""falling apart,"" but definitely concerned.
Person 1: I love your macho facade. What's that smell like shoe polish?
Person 2: So you came to comfort me?
Person 1: I didn't want you to think I was hiding something from you.
Person 2: But you were hiding.
Person 1: Not exactly. I told you I was seeing others.
Person 2: Yes, but not seriously. And now you're almost engaged!
Person 1: I'll give him back the ring.
Person 2: What?
Person 1: I don't want to marry him. Not now. I want to finish my studies, get a master's degree, start a career. I don't want to be a wife first. Sang already has a great job and earns well, but I don't want to be just a housewife.
Person 2: Sang? That's his name?
Person 1: Stop it. He's a nice guy.
Person 2: If he's so nice, why don't you want to marry him?
Person 1: I already told you.
Person 2: There's more, isn't there?
Person 1: What do you mean?
Person 2: Tell me I have nothing to do with it.
Person 1: You have nothing to do with it.
Person 2: You're lying.
Person 1: How selfish.
Person 2: I just believe that I'm the reason you're not getting married.
Person 1: If I'm so crazy about you, why am I seeing someone else?
Person 2: Jesus, you're snippy.
Person 1: I had to bring you back down to earth. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean exactly that. For years.
Person 2: Who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
Person 1: Good. Stick to that.
Person 2: But can we date?
Person 1: I'm sure Sang and your girlfriend would be thrilled about that.
Person 2: Maybe we should introduce them.
Person 1: You're serious. You want to date again.
Person 2: I'd like to be your boyfriend, yes.
Person 1: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. It'll pass.
Person 2: Give me a little more credit. I think it's time for us to be together again. I'm more mature, and so are you.
Person 1: You work in the market, that's a fact.
Person 2: Charming. Say you wouldn't want to date again.
Person 1: The key word is conversation, Dante. I think the idea of us dating is more idyllic than the reality.
Person 2: So... what? Are we supposed to pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Person 1: I don't know. Maybe we should see what happens.
Person 2: Let me take you out on a date tonight.
Person 1: A date?
Person 2: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Person 1: Dante's date: dinner and a movie. I think I've been on one of those before.
Person 2: Do you have a better suggestion?
Person 1: How about Caitlin's date: a walk on the boardwalk, then let's get naked in some secluded spot?
Person 2: I've heard that's quite a popular date.
Person 1: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself into your arms, and you call me a slut.
Person 2: What about Sang?
Person 1: He's not invited.
Person 2: He's your fiancé.
Person 1: I'm offering you my body, and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and if you didn't get why I came all the way from Ohio, it's because I'm about to be single again. And yes - let me stroke your ego - you are the inspiration for this brave decision.
Person 2: So what are you saying?
Person 1: You're such an asshole.
Person 2: Just kidding.
Person 1: I can already see this won't work.
Person 2: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Person 1: Where did he go? I thought he'd be with you like a loyal puppy.
Person 2: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't come back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll close the store and leave him a note.
Person 1: You're too responsible. But no. I need to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should deliver the message to my mom about breaking off the engagement, which will cause quite a stir because she loves Sang.
Person 2: Who doesn't love him?
Person 1: Well, apparently I don't. So, I'm leaving you now, but I'll be back in a bit, and then - yes - I'd be happy to go to dinner and a movie with you.
Person 2: What about the walk and nudity?
Person 1: I'm easy, but not that easy. See you later, handsome.",139
"Person 1: Well great, that was our last chance. What am I going to do with you now?  
Person 2: Nothing, thanks for bringing me here.  
Person 1: Where are you going? You'll freeze outside. You don't even have a coat.  
Person 2: I'll manage.  
Person 1: No, you won't. You'll freeze to death, and I'll have to live with that on my conscience. I already have enough on my plate. Do you really want me to carry that burden? Maybe you'd like something to drink?  
Person 2: No, thanks, I'll be fine.",140
"Person 1: Ed, I'm really glad that you're happy.  
Person 2: Great! So maybe we should get married?  
Person 1: What?!  
Person 2: Yes, now! Let's go to Vegas!  
Person 1: But it's raining, and the car roof won't close!  
Person 2: Don't worry about that. It's only a five-hour drive. You'll see, the weather will surely improve once we hit the desert. I'm sure it will stop raining as soon as we start driving. I promise!",141
"Person 1: I have a simple question, Lieutenant. There's no reason for you not to answer. What is your father's name?
Person 2: I call him ""Dad.""
Person 1: Do you have any siblings? Brothers, sisters?
Person 2: Yes, Dick and Jane. And also Spot, our dog.
Person 1: Are you hungry? What do you like the most? I can get it for you.
Person 2: Green Eggs and Ham. It's not going to happen. You might as well lock me up in a cell.
Person 1: You're already in a cell, O'Neil. Here and now.
Person 2: Should I be afraid?
Person 1: Yes, very much so. I'll tell you why. This is my territory. My world. Here, I can do things that would get me locked up elsewhere. Do you see that guy outside? If I can do that to a Navy SEAL, just think what I can do to you. Understand?",142
"Person 1: Marcin, can you hear me? Open the outer doors.
Person 2: Chaz, what if it's some kind of organism? Letting it in could infect the entire ship.
Person 1: We can't leave it out there to fend for itself. Please open the doors.
Person 2: Chaz, think about it. We've already broken quarantine rules. If that thing gets on board, we won't have any protection.
Person 1: Marcin, that's an order. Open the doors, you can't ignore it!",143
"Person 1: Listen, it's not our business to play detectives. I've had enough problems with all this. I don't want anything to do with it.

Person 2: What if it could clear you of all suspicions?

Person 1: Even then. It's a matter for the police. If you have any doubts, I can take you to the station.

Person 2: What? And risk every newspaper in town turning it into a sensation? No way! Listen, I want you to drop me off around the corner and wait for a moment.

Person 1: I've already said I don't want to get involved.

Person 2: Fine, brother. In that case, you can find yourself a warm place... and I'm not talking about California.",144
"Person 1: Annabelle, I know you miss your mom a lot. Maybe you should call her?  
Person 2: Why don't you call her yourself?  
Person 1: Annabelle, you really should do it.  
Person 2: Why are you imposing this on me?  
Person 1: I'm not trying to impose anything on you. I just think it would be good for you.  
Person 2: You're just a stepmother. You don't have to tell me what to do!  
Person 1: I will soon be your stepmother when I marry your dad. I want us to get along well.  
Person 2: Well, we'll see how that goes.",145
"Person 1: What do you want?  
Person 2: You really look great.  
Person 1: Come on, I look terrible.  
Person 2: Not true, you really look wonderful.  
Person 1: Get to the point, please.  
Person 2: I want to break up with Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.  
Person 1: I've already come to terms with it.  
Person 2: Don't say that!  
Person 1: I'm seeing Johannsen from chemistry now.  
Person 2: That guy? I was the one who gave him the idea to combine insect repellent with sunscreen. Did you know that?  
Person 1: He says it was different.  
Person 2: Of course, he would say that! But it doesn't matter. I care about you, Gabriela.  
Person 1: Well...  
Person 2: Give me some time to end things with Lila in a gentle way. She's a really nice girl, and I don't want to hurt her more than necessary.  
Person 1: And what about me? You hurt me when you chose Nathan. Does that not matter to you at all?",146
"Person 1: I am twenty-five years old.  
Person 2: Twenty-five? Studies show that I am most popular among men aged 11-24. You almost didn't make it! You look younger, maybe except for the upper body. Is it thanks to your service training that you're in such good shape?",147
"Person 1: Excuse me, am I speaking with Mr. Klingman?  
Person 2: Who's asking?  
Person 1: I am here on behalf of the Corleone family. I would like to speak in private.  
Person 2: We can talk here. What's this about?  
Person 1: The Corleone family advises you to settle your affairs and leave the hotel by Monday morning.  
Person 2: Do you know who you're talking to?  
Person 1: From what I've heard, you are Mr. Klingman.  
Person 2: You can't just walk in and talk like that to the owner of a hotel in Las Vegas.  
Person 1: I'm afraid you haven't quite understood the situation. You are no longer the owner.  
Person 2: Get out of here immediately!",148
"Person 1: Have you seen Tamara?  
Person 2: No, and I don't mind at all.  
Person 1: But she might be in trouble...  
Person 2: Is that something new? Come on, Ewa, don't expect me to worry about Tamara Mason. No one wants to have anything to do with her anymore.  
Person 1: I don't care what others think.",149
"Person 1: I heard that you're thinking about joining our competition.  
Person 2: I received such an offer and I'm considering it. I haven't decided anything yet.  
Person 1: Really? After everything we've been through together? So many projects we've completed together...  
Person 2: It's nothing personal, Mason. I just want to do what's best for my career.  
Person 1: I've always supported you. You can't undermine that now. Think about our team and what we've created together.",150
"Person 1: Mom, what are we...?
Person 2: Jeremiah, why do you always have to complicate everything? Couldn't we just do something my way for once, without any problems?",151
"Person 1: Mrs. Lampert...
Person 2: What do you want from me?
Person 1: Didn't Charles mention it to you?
Person 2: What was he supposed to mention?
Person 1: This doesn't belong to you, does it? You know that.
Person 2: I don't know anything about it.
Person 1: Mrs. Lampert, you should be on your guard. You might not wake up tomorrow morning.
Person 2: Please, leave me alone!
Person 1: Dead, like last week's news... like Charles, Mrs. Lampert...
Person 2: Please, stop!",152
"Person 1: Don't worry, just bring more napkins and soda water, okay?
Person 2: I'm sorry, it really was an accident.
Person 1: Oh great, now I have to pay a hundred dollars for laundry. I really needed this...",153
"Person 1: I don't think she likes surprises. And you, what are you planning to order?
Person 2: I'm not sure yet.
Person 1: Maybe it would be worth ordering something light? You know how people can judge. I want everyone to see how great you look next to that famous actor.",154
"Person 1: What is this? Is it someone who escaped from us, like Frank?  
Person 2: No, no, he didn't escape. You said you've always been in Hell. But that's not true. Look at this. This is you.  
Person 1: Nonsense, I...  
Person 2: It's really you! You weren't always like you are now. You were human. Think about it. Remember what you've lost. Remember!",155
"Person 1: I've heard about terrible things that have happened here, in our house.  
Person 2: Why are you letting strangers into the house without...  
Person 1: John, they found Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!  
Person 2: What are you talking about? Stop listening to those shows.  
Person 1: I'm taking the kids. At least until we find out what's going on. I want you to come with us, John.  
Person 2: Debra, you must be crazy.  
Person 1: You knew, didn't you, John? You knew.",156
"Person 1: Sal, you can do it, I really believe in you.
Person 2: No, I don't want to do it.
Person 1: Sal, listen to me. You really have to do this.
Person 2: I want to go home, Merle.
Person 1: Think it over carefully, Sal. If you don't do it, they might get you into serious trouble. And you know what will happen then...
Person 2: Merle, I really want to go home!",157
"Person 1: Professor, we need to talk.  
Person 2: What's going on, Dwight?  
Person 1: I think we should seriously consider ending the experiment early.  
Person 2: Why do you think that?  
Person 1: Something much stronger is happening in this house than I anticipated. In one night, I recorded cold spots, changes in the magnetic field, and our equipment is picking up strange noises everywhere.  
Person 2: That's exactly why we're here, remember?  
Person 1: Yes, but I've seen the recordings. This poltergeist is becoming more aggressive. We could all be in danger. We really should end this now.  
Person 2: Calm down, Dwight. I'm the one who decides when we finish. We're on the brink of a great discovery, and I'm one step away from achieving everything I've worked for. The bus will arrive on Monday. Until then, no one leaves this place.",158
"Person 1: No, of course not... I never killed anyone.  
Person 2: But maybe the temptation was too strong?  
Person 1: No! I warned the English to go back home. I begged them not to force us to fight. They knew what defeat I would bring upon them... Why didn't they listen to me?  
Person 2: We have many witnesses who claim that you didn't always carry your banner.  
Person 1: Yes, that's true... maybe...  
Person 2: So sometimes you only had a sword in your hand?  
Person 1: Yes, but...  
Person 2: Did you use that sword?  
Person 1: No, I... I raised it to...  
Person 2: You raised it and waved it in the air? Just like now?  
Person 1: Yes, maybe... I don't remember...  
Person 2: So you were in the middle of the battlefield, with a sword in your hand, waving it above your head, charging at the enemy, shouting and fighting for your life... and you want to tell us that in all that chaos you didn't kill anyone?  
Person 1: No, I... I never killed anyone!  ",159
"Person 1: So, will you let me in, or what?  
Person 2: You know, everyone is home, so it's probably not the best time.  
Person 1: Come on, don't be like that. Let's go see what's going on.",160
"Person 1: Hello?  
Person 2: Hi, it's Daniel.  
Person 1: Daniel? What's going on? I'm in the middle of something important...  
Person 2: I have recordings that could determine your brother's fate. If you want him out of prison, you need to do exactly as I say. Bring a million euros to your boat today at six.  
Person 1: A million euros? Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?  
Person 2: Don't pretend, Laurant. I know you have access to the Van Gogh money.  
Person 1: I don't have it. Vincent went to Chicago to get it, but he was arrested before he could bring anything back.  
Person 2: You better find that money. Six o'clock on the boat, and come alone. If not, we'll destroy the recordings, and your brother will stay in prison for a long time.",161
"Person 1: Seriously? Does that mean you're starting to be normal?  
Person 2: No, it means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going there.  
Person 1: I thought maybe you had a date. I don't even know why I'm asking, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party on Saturday?  
Person 2: What do you think?  
Person 1: I think you're weird. You do it just to annoy me. I think you're hopeless.",162
"Person 1: Who did it?  
Person 2: I'm not sure. But this guy is a really dangerous type. Iris knew someone was following her... and she warned that you might be in danger too. You need to disappear from here as soon as possible, Faith. Come with me, don't think too long.  
Person 1: And what then? What's next, Lenny?! Are you going to protect me? You act tough, but you talk a lot, Lenny. You don't even have a weapon.  
Person 2: I have a weapon. It's hidden under my bed.  
Person 1: You have no idea what you're getting into.  
Person 2: So tell me.",163
"Person 1: Hey, what happened with Salvy while I was away?
Person 2: What exactly are you asking about?
Person 1: You know, when you beat him up.
Person 2: Oh, that. Salvy went a bit too far, he was probably drunk. Anyway, it got to the point where I hit him. Tommy reconciled us, and we've already forgotten about it.
Person 1: Why didn't you mention this to me earlier?
Person 2: It had nothing to do with you.
Person 1: Are you sure it didn't concern me?
Person 2: Yes, I just told you what happened.
Person 1: Didn't it have something to do with Vickie?
Person 2: Jack, no. I've already explained everything to you. It was a matter between me and Salvy. If it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I would have definitely told you.
Person 1: Because I heard some rumors...",164
"Person 1: Hey, Anthony, could you lend me that credit card for a moment?  
Person 2: I'm not too fond of using that card, Dignan.  
Person 1: Why are you so worried about it?  
Person 2: Because the bill goes to my mom.  
Person 1: You know, she won't even notice, Anthony. Really.  
Person 2: I'd rather not use it.  
Person 1: In that case, if you don't need it, maybe just throw it away?  
Person 2: I'm keeping it for a rainy day.  
Person 1: Anthony, we're really in a tough spot. This is exactly that rainy day. It's only fair that...",165
"Person 1: I think they won't come after all.
Person 2: Why do you think that? They have to show up!
Person 1: And why should they?
Person 2: Because I have always been faithful to God, followed His will... I did everything He asked of me...
Person 1: Do you really believe that God asked you for something?
Person 2: Yes... many things!
Person 1: Are you saying that God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?""
Person 2: Maybe not literally, but He sent me signs!
Person 1: What signs do you mean?
Person 2: You know... the wind, the clouds, the bells... And that sword in the field... it had to be a sign!
Person 1: Or just a sword that someone left there.
Person 2: But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Person 1: That's true, everything has its causes. But why assume it's a sign from God? There are many ways the sword could have ended up there...",166
"Person 1: Listen, I have to go. I'll be late for the play.  
Person 2: Are you going with Chet?  
Person 1: Chet? To a play? You must be joking.  
Person 2: Then come with me.  
Person 1: Knox, you're relentless!  
Person 2: Just give me one chance. If you don't like me after tonight, I'll disappear forever.  
Person 1: Yeah, right.  
Person 2: I promise. Go with me tonight, and if you don't want to see me afterward, I swear I'll back off.  
Person 1: God, if Chet found out, he would...  
Person 2: Chet won't find out. We'll sit in the back and slip out right after it ends.  
Person 1: Knox, if you promise this will be the end...  
Person 2: I promise.  
Person 1: What does that mean?  
Person 2: You can trust me.",167
"Person 1: I heard that you were going through my messages on my phone. Why are you invading my privacy?
Person 2: I was worried about you and your new acquaintances. I only did it because I care about you and want to protect you.
Person 1: Just because you love me doesn't give you the right to break my trust, Ryan. We need to set boundaries in our relationship.
Person 2: I understand that now. I'm sorry I overstepped, but I was really worried about us.
Person 1: It's important for us to talk honestly and trust each other. Let's work on that.",168
"Person 1: You know what, you really don't measure up to the rest. You need to try harder.
Person 2: Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm doing quite well. I don't need to prove anything.",169
"Person 1: How long have you been doing... what you do?
Person 2: And why are you interested?
Person 1: Just asking, in case someone ever asks about it.
Person 2: Well, I've been doing it for fifteen years, but I prefer the term ""assassin.""
Person 1: What about any benefits? Do you have any?
Person 2: No, I don't.
Person 1: And sick leave, paid vacations?
Person 2: Listen, if you start talking to me about forming a union, our conversation might end very unpleasantly. Now get out of the taxi.",170
"Person 1: Hey, let's go for a drink!
Person 2: You know, I really don't like alcohol.
Person 1: Come on! You have to go, it's our tradition. Everyone is going, you can't let us down!
Person 2: If everyone is going, I guess I have no choice.",171
"Person 1: Why were you holding that boy by the collar?  
Person 2: What do you mean?  
Person 1: That little boy. I saw you holding him. Why did you do it?  
Person 2: Can we change the subject?  
Person 1: What are you planning now? Are you going to take him to your room? Where is it? Here?  
Person 2: Please, stop.  
Person 1: I've watched you at various meetings. How can you pretend everything is fine? How can you smile as if nothing happened?  
Person 2: Do you know why? I'm trying to keep everything under control. She's resisting.  
Person 1: Dance with me.  
Person 2: No.  
Person 1: Dance with me. I want to reclaim what is mine.  
Person 2: Do you think you're the only one who feels something? Do you really think that?  ",172
"Person 1: How did things go with Frank?
Person 2: He was fine.
Person 1: That's it? Nothing more? Just an ordinary guy?
Person 2: He was nicer than most.
Person 1: But still just a guy, right?
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: Although nicer than others?
Person 2: Yes. I have no control over that.
Person 1: So why did you meet with him so often?
Person 2: Once a week?
Person 1: To me, that's quite often.
Person 2: He was a gentleman. I like that.
Person 1: Once a week is enough to like a gentleman?
Person 2: Listen, I am myself, and you are yourself. We can't change that. Why do you keep pressing me?
Person 1: What bothered him?
Person 2: He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday, I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would kill us both! He followed me home and caused a scene on the street, and I had to tell Frank that I couldn't see him anymore. It was too risky. He said he would kill himself. I was afraid of what you might do.",173
"Person 1: What happened? Did you lose your job?  
Person 2: Yes, Morgan. I was fired.  
Person 1: Really? But it was quite a simple job. I thought sweeping the floor wouldn't be a problem for anyone.",174
"Person 1: Thanks. So... are we going to talk about it now or not?  
Person 2: I don't know what to say, Mary. I want to do what's right.  
Person 1: Do you love me? Did you ever love me? I listened to the recording. I can't believe I kept it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I'm talking about our sex, and I can't even picture you naked. I can't even say ""naked"" to you!  
Person 2: I have a family, Mary.  
Person 1: You made me make the decision about the abortion.  
Person 2: It was our joint decision.  
Person 1: You made me erase you from my memory! I loved you. I still love you! How could you--  
Person 2: I didn't force you. You yourself thought it was the best solution. But, listen, I take full responsibility.",175
"Person 1: Don't run away from who you are. If you have a trait, let it define you. Develop it, because it is a part of you. By helping me, you'll discover something new for yourself as well.

Person 2: What? What are you talking about? Why should I help you?

Person 1: Because you really want to. You've always desired it. Look at your paintings, at your sculptures. See those unassuming works, and then... Imagine. Imagine a world where the body becomes a canvas. The body as clay, our will as the brush and knife. I have sights to show you that you haven't seen before.",176
"Person 1: I see that something is bothering you.  
Person 2: I need your help.  
Person 1: I've heard that you might be trying to convince me of something... But you really should rest, Mr. Parker. It's for your own good. I know your history and I know how much you've been through. It's impressive.  
Person 2: Have you ever lost someone, Stephanie?  
Person 1: Mr. Parker, maybe you should eat something first? I'll bring you some fish sticks.",178
"Person 1: I'm not going to do it. And if I tell Drew about this, he won't agree to it either.  
Person 2: You won't tell him, and even if you do, he'll just use it as a topic for his speech at the Wharton graduation. So why bother?  
Person 1: You're awful.  
Person 2: I know, but I'm your father, so you have to listen to me.",179
"Person 1: I'm glad you came. I feel lost without you.  
Person 2: I want us to be together, but I need to know that you truly want to change. I need proof.  
Person 1: Maybe some risky decision?  
Person 2: Rather honesty. Tell me what you plan.  
Person 1: Give me a kiss, and I'll tell you everything.  
Person 2: Tell me first, and then I'll kiss you.  
Person 1: Freeze has turned the telescope into a weapon. He wants to freeze the whole city.  
Person 2: I have to stop him.  
Person 1: But first, one kiss, okay? For luck.",180
"Person 1: Alright, I believe you. Who exactly are you?  
Person 2: Harry York. I work for Martoni Kamiński, who is running for Congress in this district.  
Person 1: Aha! I've seen you in the news!  
Person 2: Yes, that's possible...  
Person 1: My dad also did something for Kamiński...  
Person 2: Exactly. You wouldn't want your dad to get into trouble, right?  
Person 1: What do you mean?  
Person 2: Well... the newspapers are already calling us communists, and you appear as the friendly neighborhood atheist...  
Person 1: But I'm not an atheist. The newspapers...  
Person 2: I know, I know. You're no more an atheist than my boss is a communist. But you see, people might associate your views with ours, which could look bad for your dad.  
Person 1: Yes. It could also look bad for you and Kamiński, right?",181
"Person 1: The Lamb Club?  
Person 2: Of course, the Lamb Club. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a pike as their symbol?  
Person 1: That's a wolf's head.  
Person 2: Exactly, the Lamb Club. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol?  
Person 1: It's not a pike, it's a spear.  
Person 2: A severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol.  
Person 1: David, before we go in there, I want you to know that - whatever happens - it will be your fault.  
Person 2: Relax, I always take responsibility.  
Person 1: Alright then.  
Person 2: Shall we go?",182
"Person 1: Stop it, Miles. You're really missing a great opportunity. Maya is a great girl. She's amazing, funny, and knows a lot about wine. Why are you so gloomy? They want to have a good time! And what was that long lecture about... what was it called? Vouvray? Come on!
Person 2: I just feel uncomfortable with this whole situation.
Person 1: Seriously, Miles? Really?",183
"Person 1: It's not what you think! I won't allow it. You want to flirt? Go ahead, do whatever you want!

Person 2: It's not about Caitlin...

Person 1: You don't even know what you want. I'm not going to sit and wait for you to get your act together. I encouraged you to change something, go back to school, start taking action. I even moved so you might feel more motivated to study. Everyone said it was foolish, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted you to get out of the stagnation you've been in since that woman left you. And now you want to go back to her so she can hurt you again?

Person 2: I don't want to go back to her...

Person 1: Of course, you don't want to... now that you've been caught. But I won't let you. I want you to do it and see how wrong you are. And when she dumps you again - because she will, Dante, believe me - I'll be laughing so you understand what you've lost. I'm just glad Randal had the courage to tell me, since you couldn't.

Person 2: Randal...?

Person 1: Yes, he's the one who told me. And that shows how much courage you lack.

Person 2: Veronica, I love you...

Person 1: Forget about me.",184
"Person 1: Are you feeling okay? There's something wrong with you.
Person 2: Let's just move on, there's no point in discussing it.",185
"Person 1: Marcel, I think you confused the Black Panther with the Pink Panther. The Black Panther was an activist group from the sixties.  
Person 2: Pink, black, what does it matter? Besides, I don't recall asking you anything.  
Person 1: There's no need to use such language. Maybe you're projecting your frustration onto me?  
Person 2: What are you even talking about?  
Person 1: I'm talking about how we should communicate—honestly and with respect.  
Person 2: Maybe you should stop lecturing and focus on something else?",186
"Person 1: Wilhelm, we're talking about everyday matters, right? That's why I'm curious about what your private life looks like. Can you tell me how many children you have outside of marriage?  
Person 2: Major, I'm not sure how that question is related to our topic...  
Person 1: David, are you trying to defend him now? Didn't you hear my question?",187
"Person 1: Let me explain the situation. You've been here for three months, and we're already two months behind schedule. The Germans and the French are ready. I don't care what happens to you or how many people we've lost. The only thing that matters is my knighthood. If this railway line is completed on time, I'll get the title, and I care a lot about that. Maybe I'll hire professional hunters.

Person 2: They'll only bring more chaos, and we already have enough of that. Once they show up, word will spread—and what then about your knighthood?

Person 1: I'll try to find Redbeard—I assume you've heard of him.

Person 2: Anyone who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him. By the time you find him, the lions might already be dead.

Person 1: Fine, you still have this job, but I'm leaving. If I have to come back, you're finished. I'll do everything to destroy your reputation. Aren't I fair? I told you you'd hate me.",188
"Person 1: I lost a filling from a back tooth. I need to go to the dentist tomorrow.  
Person 2: The dentist? We haven't worked for four months, and you want to spend the first money we've earned on teeth?  
Person 1: It's just a small filling, it doesn't even have to be gold...  
Person 2: How can you be so selfish? We're behind on rent, we owe Moe almost five hundred dollars, and three Chinese restaurants are after us because our check bounced. We've already borrowed from everyone we know.  
Person 1: You're right, Joe.  
Person 2: Of course, I am.  
Person 1: Maybe we should pay off at least part of the debts tomorrow morning.  
Person 2: No, we can't do that.  
Person 1: Why not?  
Person 2: Tomorrow we're going to the racetrack and betting everything on Greased Lightning.  
Person 1: You want to bet my money on a race?  
Person 2: He's sure to win. Max, the waiter, told me that his brother-in-law, who works at the track, says everything is rigged...  
Person 1: What's with this rabbit?  
Person 2: Look at the odds - ten to one. If he wins, we'll pay everyone back.  
Person 1: And if he loses?  
Person 2: Why are you worried? The work doesn't end.  
Person 1: And if it does end?  
Person 2: Jerry, why do you always think pessimistically? What if you get hit by a truck? Or the stock market crashes?",189
"Person 1: Why were you in the hospital?  
Person 2: I don't know.  
Person 1: Out of curiosity?  
Person 2: I guess so...  
Person 1: Curiosity related to Susan?  
Person 2: I wouldn't call it that.  
Person 1: And how would you call it?  
Person 2: Tell me, Bill.  
Person 1: Maybe you'd better tell me. I'm asking a simple question and I expect a clear answer. That's what I require. If someone doesn't give it to me, they might lose their job.  
Person 2: Do you want to fire me, Bill?  ",190
"Person 1: Oh, so now you're defending Joe? What, are you planning to defend him in court or in bed? And I'm not talking about us, but about you two.  
Person 2: I've had enough. Get out of here.  
Person 1: So no quickie, then?",191
"Person 1: I want to kill myself.  
Person 2: Why do you say that?  
Person 1: Because it seems to you that I'm like someone who is constantly seeking attention.  
Person 2: No, I don't think that at all. Sometimes you just seem mysterious in a way that draws attention. It's hard to understand, especially for us married women who lost that mysteriousness long ago.  
Person 1: But you are still mysterious! Really!  
Person 2: No, I'm just different. Being mysterious and being different are not the same thing.  
Person 1: But I am different.  
Person 2: No, you are unique. Being unique and being different are different things.  
Person 1: Peggy, maybe I'm really lost. But I love you and I promise I'll stop flirting with Cory. Please, forgive me.",192
"Person 1: Give your word of honor that you won't try to escape and will smuggle us across the border.  
Person 2: I give my word of honor that I won't try to escape and will do everything in my power to smuggle you into Mexico.  
Person 1: You better succeed, man.",193
"Person 1: What, are you scared and don't want to go?
Person 2: Of course, if you're so brave, then why not go all the way? Maybe try robbing Fort Knox right away or do something equally crazy. Good luck, I'm sure you'll succeed.",194
"Person 1: Maybe you should go out after all. It's really important.
Person 2: Why do you keep trying to impose your opinion on me?
Person 1: Really, it's for your own good. Trust me, it will be better if you go out.
Person 2: This really irritates me. I don't want you telling me what to do.
Person 1: I know it's annoying, but believe me, it will be better if you do it.
Person 2: It's always the same! I can decide for myself what to do.",195
"Person 1: Do you really think that if they catch her, she won't be in danger? Do you think the threat of violence isn't used to manipulate men?
Person 2: You already broke many rules before I stopped counting.
Person 1: I've had enough of this. Just because they pay me like a caretaker doesn't mean I'll be a nanny.
Person 2: She's a trainee, like everyone else. Why are you so hard on her?
Person 1: She's an officer. She has to adhere to higher standards.
Person 2: You're hard on her because she's a woman.
Person 1: Of course I am. And I will keep pushing her until everyone understands that this isn't a matter of equality, but a real threat to life. Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Person 2: I should report you.
Person 1: You probably would if you didn't know that I'm right.",196
"Person 1: What's up with her? You didn't invite her, you're scared, right?  
Person 2: ...I didn't invite her?  
Person 1: You look scared.  
Person 2: Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?  
Person 1: Yes, I know, but why are you asking?  
Person 2: She left her purse at my work, and I wanted to return it to her.  
Person 1: She didn't leave it. You're lying.  
Person 2: Please, don't make this difficult for me.  
Person 1: Why do you want to know where she is?  
Person 2: I just want to know where she's staying.  
Person 1: Tell me why.  
Person 2: Don't treat me like this, please. It's important to me.  
Person 1: What are you talking about? Stop it.  
Person 2: I just need her number. Give it to me, Elżbieta, please, or else I'll do something I'll regret.",197
"Person 1: You look pretty good for someone who's over two thousand years old. I checked the clocks. It confirms Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for about two thousand years. You still can't accept it, can you?

Person 2: (long pause) You know it's hard for me to accept.

Person 1: Because time has destroyed everything that was important to you. It's all just memories now.

Person 2: Prove it. If we can't go back, it's still just a theory.

Person 1: This is reality, Landon. You have to accept it. It will make things easier for you.",198
"Person 1: Hey, let's take a lunch break! I can buy you a beer on the way. It will be a perfect opportunity to relax.
Person 2: You know, I really need to finish this...
Person 1: Oh, come on, it won't go anywhere. You really deserve a moment of rest, trust me.",199
"Person 1: Mom, they are disgusting.  
Person 2: Sex is not disgusting; it's one of the most beautiful things in life. It's something that drives the entire universe.  
Person 1: I know, Mom.  
Person 2: But we have to respect it and be truly fascinated by it.  
Person 1: I am, I really am.  
Person 2: I'm not sure if enough. Bring the castor oil.  
Person 1: Oh no, Mom, not the castor oil.  
Person 2: It's not a punishment; I don't believe in punishments. It's for your health. If you're behaving like this, maybe you're sick.",200
"Person 1: Don't you think this place is overrated?  
Person 2: Oh, I have similar feelings, Mr. Holland.  
Person 1: It's easy to notice when you're new. Everything seems beautiful because you haven't yet seen the truth. Those flying fish—they're not jumping for joy, but out of fear. They're fleeing from bigger fish that want to devour them. And that luminous water? Its glow comes from millions of tiny, dead creatures. It's just an illusion of beauty, the glow of decay. There's no real beauty here—only death and decay.  
Person 2: Do you really think so? How can you look at it that way?",201
"Person 1: I thought that meeting face-to-face would help me understand my feelings.
Person 2: And did it help?
Person 1: Yes, I understood one thing.
Person 2: What?
Person 1: That you are quite egocentric, a bit like your mom.",202
"Person 1: Breakfast is probably ready, right?
Person 2: No, it's not.
Person 1: So what are you doing then?
Person 2: I don't want to be deceived. When I heard that word, I knew it was something I wanted to avoid.
Person 1: That's exactly how you should speak.
Person 2: This isn't a game. I'm looking for love and affection.
Person 1: You don't know what you really want. That's how God made you!
Person 2: I won't be fooled. I remember when you pulled the hook out of the fish and said it didn't feel pain.
Person 1: Because it really didn't!
Person 2: I'd like to hear the opinion of that fish—and yours.
Person 1: Fish don't feel.
Person 2: But I do. Some wounds, whether physical or spiritual, are painful for me. I'm no longer a naive waitress. Maybe you're right about the fish, but I've changed. I have my own opinions and knowledge. I know much more—also about you.
Person 1: For example?
Person 2: For example, about heroes and their complicated relationships with women.
Person 1: Tell me about it.
Person 2: It's complicated, and I don't want to get into it now so it doesn't sound bad—even though it's just the truth.
Person 1: I like the truth. I wouldn't be here if I didn't value it.
Person 2: Well, heroes often don't like domestic life and leave a mess behind.
Person 1: Go on.
Person 2: They have mixed feelings about women, sometimes they don't even like them. One of the reasons they like war is the opportunity to take enemy women without delicacy. They can ""deceive"" them, as you say—for revenge.
Person 1: Did you learn this in college?
Person 2: Yes, and Norbert told me about it.
Person 1: That doctor?
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: What is most valuable to him?
Person 2: Probably his violin.
Person 1: Does he keep it in his apartment?
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: And no one is there now?
Person 2: I don't think so.
Person 1: That's a shame. I'd prefer he was home to see what I'm going to do.
Person 2: What are you going to do?
Person 1: He ruined my reputation in the eyes of women. Now I'm going to destroy his violin.
Person 2: You won't do that!
Person 1: Why not?
Person 2: Because if you do, I'll leave you. Goodbye.",203
"Person 1: With age, you gain something unique that can influence the future. By feeling it, you become part of a larger whole.  
Person 2: That doesn't sound good.  
Person 1: It's not as terrible as it seems. But the consequences can be frightening. They give you great power - knowledge. You can become a bridge between the past and the future.  
Person 2: I don't feel it.  
Person 1: You're not ready yet, but you'll learn. You have talent, which is why our friend is worried.  
Person 2: Why would he care about me?  
Person 1: This power is divided among all of us, but not everyone has the same amount. You and he have more.  
Person 2: And you?  
Person 1: I'm just a helper. But if I can help you defeat this monster, my life will have meaning.  
Person 2: I'm not ready.  
Person 1: You must be. You have responsibilities. You need to know the rules. Don't draw attention to yourself, don't show your true nature. You will always sense the presence of others. Be careful. Your battle will be with time. You will see how everything changes. But without morality, life is empty. Others live only to fight. Don't be like them.  
Person 2: I understand.  
Person 1: You are young and inexperienced. You don't yet know what time can do to a person.  
Person 2: That's not me.  
Person 1: With the right tools, even a naive person can be very dangerous.",204
"Person 1: Harry, I have to go now. I want to talk to my mom.  
Person 2: Frances, it seems to me that you're not yourself right now. Think it over again. Who do you think placed you in Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks there's something wrong with you, and she'll keep thinking that as long as it suits her.  
Person 1: No, she just wanted to protect me from prison, nothing more.  
Person 2: Really? Your mom is clever and calculating, Frances. I'm not going to take you there, and that's that!",205
"Person 1: You're looking at me so strangely. I should trust you, but if I find out something, I won't be able to control myself...

Person 2: Go ahead, then. Finish everyone off. Salvy, Vickie, Tommy Como, even me. What do I care? You're destroying yourself, stuffing your face and worrying about nonsense.

Person 1: What do you mean by ""you""?

Person 2: What?

Person 1: What do you mean by ""you""?

Person 2: I'm saying you should finish everyone off. You, me, anyone. You're the boss. Act if you want to.

Person 1: But you said ""you.""

Person 2: So what?

Person 1: Joey, even you don't know what you're saying. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, yourself — that means something. Why did you mention them specifically?

Person 2: You're worried about that girl, letting her ruin your life... You better worry about your stomach, which you can't bend — you have a fight in a month.

Person 1: Have you ever been with my wife?

Person 2: What?

Person 1: Not now, before — before we met.

Person 2: What do you mean?

Person 1: Have you ever been with my wife?

Person 2: What's wrong with you?

Person 1: You're very clever, Joey, very clever. You beat around the bush, but you didn't answer my question. Were you with Vickie?

Person 2: I have to go. I can't listen to this. Lenore is waiting for me. I have to leave. You're a total nutcase. Really, you're crazy.",206
"Person 1: If you don't want to go with me, just say so. Say 'Kenny, I don't want to do this,' but don't blame it on your dad. I'm really fed up with it.

Person 2: I'm not using him as an excuse.

Person 1: Of course you are. You always do. That's why we broke up. You're always hiding behind him.

Person 2: That's not true.

Person 1: I feel like I have to ask your dad for permission to kiss you. Jody, you need to start making your own decisions. Be an adult, independent. I'm going to a party today, Jimmy will give me a ride. Come over to my place after school, we'll go together.

Person 2: I have to go home after school. I have something important to discuss with my mom.

Person 1: They won't pick me up before six.

Person 2: I'll think about it.

Person 1: Great!",207
"Person 1: I don't remember exactly. How much do I owe you?
Person 2: It's eleven zlotys and twenty-five groszy. You know I always tell the truth.",208
"Person 1: Tell me something nice, please.  
Person 2: Alright, I like you, Dil.  
Person 1: Maybe... you could say that you love me?  
Person 2: Hmm, if that's what you want, then of course.  
Person 1: I would really like to hear that.  
Person 2: Alright, I love you, Dil.  
Person 1: Really? Do you really feel that way?  
Person 2: Yes, I really feel that way.  
Person 1: And what would you do for me if you could?  
Person 2: Well, I would do anything you desire.  ",209
"Person 1: What was that? Did you hear that noise?  
Person 2: Don't worry, darling. My people have everything under control. It's nothing serious.  
Person 1: It sounded like it was coming from the courtyard.  
Person 2: Probably from the walls. They're conducting defense exercises now, which I organized myself.  
Person 1: Maybe we could see it?  
Person 2: Later, sweetheart... Right now, I just want to be with you...",210
"Person 1: I expect you to let me know what's going on. If Huey Newton goes to the bathroom, I want to know everything that happened there. If you don't do this, I will have to find you. And then I won't be as ""nice"" as I am now.
Person 2: I understand.",211
"Person 1: Admit it, you are responsible for Dominik's death! Everyone is already talking about it, so you'd better confess.
Person 2: What? That's absurd! I have nothing to do with it, and you all must be crazy if you believe that!",212
"Person 1: Hey, you said that we would always work together, or not at all!
Person 2: No, I think you misunderstood me. I only said that it would be nice if we could always work together. That's all.",213
"Person 1: Jeanne, you must listen to me carefully. We are deeply religious people, and we truly care about the salvation of your soul. We act on behalf of the Church, which always accepts those who wish to return to it. But we cannot help you if you do not accept our judgment and authority. Think about it carefully, because if you continue to reject our help, we will be forced to hand you over to the secular authorities. You know what that means. So now... will you recite the Lord's Prayer?

Person 2: No, not unless you first hear my confession.",214
"Person 1: Sarah told me that you were talking about our private matters at the party.  
Person 2: Well, I did say too much, but I didn't think it would get back to you. Really, it's nothing.  
Person 1: Did you really want to hurt me? Why did you betray our secrets?  
Person 2: I'm sorry, Lisa. I know it was a mistake, but are you sure you're not overreacting? I should have been more careful, but couldn't you be more understanding?",215
"Person 1: Do you really not have the heart to let the poor eat first?
Person 2: Could you really not skip a meal just this once?",216
"Person 1: Listen, my father told me many things. He really wanted me to understand his point of view, but sometimes it's hard to remember everything.
Person 2: I understand, my father always said that he is a father first, not a friend.
Person 1: And how do you feel about that?
Person 2: To be honest, I don't quite agree with it.
Person 1: So maybe don't worry too much about his words. Listen to me. You'll understand why you got married and why you love her when you wake up in the middle of the night, and the streetlight gently illuminates her face. She will look like an angel, and her hair will smell sweet. Then you'll feel that she is all yours. Do you see where I'm going with this?",217
"Person 1: Ania, have you ever wondered why Graham doesn't want you to go to therapy?
Person 2: What do you mean?
Person 1: You know, maybe Graham has his own reasons for not liking therapy. Maybe he has issues he doesn't want to deal with, and he'd prefer if you didn't change either. Do you think that's possible?
Person 2: Maybe you're right.
Person 1: You know, you can always quit therapy if you want to, right?
Person 2: Yes, I know.
Person 1: And that you don't have to explain anything to me?
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: Do you want to quit therapy?
Person 2: Probably not.
Person 1: Do you feel that we can still achieve a lot?
Person 2: Yes.
Person 1: That's great, because I think so too.

"Person 1: Do you have any evidence for what you're saying?  
Person 2: Well, you know...  
Person 1: Are you sure you're telling the truth?  
Person 2: Well...

Person 2: I'm not lying.  
Person 1: You know that no one likes it when someone lies, right? Do you want people to see you that way?  
Person 2: I said I'm not lying.",219
"Person 1: Dad, you know that by causing some damage, I bring something positive into life. After all, we do something similar, right?  
Person 2: It's one thing to break a glass, and another to produce weapons that kill people. Those are completely different things.  
Person 1: Relax, Dad... I will never cause as many deaths as religion has over the past 2000 years.",220
"Person 1: Frank, are you really against me now? After everything I've done for you?
Person 2: No, I just...",221

Person 2: That's interesting! You know what, come with us after the lecture. There's this cool place on the Hill, I keep trying to get Trip to take me there.  
Person 1: Actually... I'd just like to go home.  
Person 2: Come on, who at your age wants to go straight home? Besides, there will be professors there. Think of it as a school trip you can't miss.",224

Person 1: I'm wondering whose side you're on.  
Person 2: You didn't arrange to meet me 50 kilometers from the office to talk about the Bible.

Person 2: I said, leave me alone.  
Person 1: Is that how you talk to an old school friend?

Person 2: I will not give you and your people full control. I will not write bills in Congress that allow the NSA to do whatever they want. And if you want to talk, let's do it officially, in my office, like everyone else. Now get out of my car, I have a meeting on Capitol Hill.",230

Person 2: Unless what?

Person 2: You said that when we first met. And back then, you didn't even know me.",236
"Person 1: Paweł, I know you're feeling down after that accident.  
Person 2: I really wanted to play next year. It was very important to me.  
Person 1: I understand how difficult this must be for you.  
Person 2: Yes.  
Person 1: But now you're faced with an important choice. You can let this accident get you down, or you can see it as a new opportunity. I believe you have a great future ahead of you, and I'm not just talking about success in sports.  
Person 2: What do you mean?  
Person 1: I'll give you a hint. You're a natural leader. You're one of the most liked students at Millard. People value your honesty and straightforwardness. You can perform under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. Other students look up to you with admiration. What could that mean?",237
"Person 1: Can you tell me what you are actually good at? Sometimes I wonder why you do such silly things.
Person 2: Maybe I don't know him as well as you do, but he's my uncle, and I feel I owe him an answer. It's like a Hemingway-style adventure, only instead of an old man, I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's the Parisian tunnels. And what will I discover at the end? That's what I want to find out. See you.",238
"Person 1: Why did you say ""thank goodness""?

Person 2: Well, you know, are you sure you're ready for a child? Isn't this just age-related pressure?

Person 1: No, no, really not... I still have plenty of time, right? At least six more years, if I'm counting correctly. We could even have three kids if we wanted to. I know I always said I didn't want kids, but this year I really feel like I'm ready...

Person 2: Darling, I'm not worried about you. I know you'll be a great mom. That's not the problem. After all, I was the one encouraging you, remember? But Joe is a different matter.

Person 1: Oh, Soph, Joe loves kids. He really wants to have children. He thinks it's important.

Person 2: He wants playmates. He's sweet, Sal, you know I like him. But as a father... I'm not sure he'll manage.

Person 1: Come on, let's sit down. The carpet seems quite nice.",239
"Person 1: I need to ask you something serious.  
Person 2: What happened?  
Person 1: Aren't you worried that you might never experience physical love?  
Person 2: Sure, that really worries me. Just like climate change.  
Person 1: Think about it, on your way home, there could be an accident and everything could end. You might never experience closeness with someone.  
Person 2: Unless sheep count.  
Person 1: It's not about me...  
Person 2: I know, I'm joking. Relax.  
Person 1: I'm trying to be honest, and you're joking.  
Person 2: Sorry, Rod. I don't think you'll remain a virgin forever.",240
"Person 1: Where are you going?
Person 2: Let me go! I have to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you do this to me?
Person 1: Get Bruce out of jail? How can you worry about someone who’s sitting calmly at the police station when so much is happening here? Hildy, there’s a war going on here! You can’t back out now!
Person 2: Stop with the talk! You have your story! Put it on the front page — ""Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post""! Take all the credit — I covered this story and got into quite a bit of trouble — now I’m backing out! I know I’ve told you this twice today, but now I’m serious!
Person 1: You fool! What are you talking about, backing out! There are 365 days in a year to get married, but how often do you have a murderer locked up in the office? Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you’ve got the whole city in your hands!
Person 2: I know, but...
Person 1: You know? Your brain is like a pancake! This wasn’t just a story you covered — it was a revolution! Hildy! It’s the biggest story in journalism since Stanley found Livingstone!
Person 2: Wait a minute — wasn’t it Stanley who found Livingstone?
Person 1: Don’t be petty at a time like this! Do you realize what you’ve done? You took a city that was corrupt for forty years under the same old gang, and with this story, you’re throwing them out, giving us a chance for a government like New York has under La Guardia! We’ll make such fools of these politicians that no one will vote for them — not even their own wives!
Person 2: I’d like to think about it.
Person 1: Well, think about it, because it’s true! We’ll crucify that bunch. We’ll keep Williams hidden until morning so the Post can publish an exclusive story. Then we’ll inform the governor about the capture — we’ll share the glory with him.
Person 2: I understand!
Person 1: You’ve turned the whole City Hall upside down like an apple cart. You’ve put the mayor and Hartman against the wall. You’ve changed one administration for another. This isn’t just a news story — it’s a career! And you’re standing there fussing about whether you’ll catch the eight o’clock or nine o’clock train! Still such a doll! That’s all you are.
Person 2: Give me that typewriter, and I’ll show you how a doll can write!
Person 1: Bravo! They’ll name streets after you — Hildy Johnson Street! There’ll be your statues in parks, Hildy. Radio will chase you — movies! By tomorrow morning, I bet there’ll be a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can already see the billboards. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Person 2: Hey, wait a minute. We can’t leave Williams here. Someone else will notice him —
Person 1: We’ll take him to my private office. Where’s our phone?
Person 2: That one — how will you take him? They’ll see him.",241
"Person 1: Admit it, you're dying of curiosity to peek into my room, aren't you?  
Person 2: If you want me to come so much, why don't you invite me?  
Person 1: Could it be that you're too proud to admit you've gone crazy about me, Dr. Jones?  
Person 2: I think you've gotten too used to always getting what you want, Willie...",242
"Person 1: I really don't feel well, I have not only a headache but also stomach problems. Can you apologize to everyone on my behalf?  
Person 2: El, hang in there! You're as strong as ever. I'll bring you something for your stomach, and you'll give your speech. Then we'll go back to Sacramento. This is not the time to rest. Regardless of what the polls say, you can't give up now. Remember what happened with Bush? If you really want to skip the speech in Sacramento, do it now, and then we'll rest away from this smog.",243
"Person 1: Mrs. Hinkle, do you ever drink alcohol?  
Person 2: No, I don't really drink.  
Person 1: So, are you saying that when you received those alleged obscene phone calls, you were completely sober?  
Person 2: Of course!  
Person 1: And on the day I was at Mrs. Ackerman's, when you claim you recognized my voice, you hadn't drunk anything either?  
Person 2: Well, one beer with lunch probably doesn't count.",244
"Person 1: What does your instinct tell you, my friend?
Person 2: To leave. Go back to Detroit and get our money back.
Person 1: We can do that. You can go to Florida, I can go to Thailand and enjoy life.
Person 2: ...but that's not what we're going to do, is it?
Person 1: No... if we don't finish this job, how will we look each other in the eye? This is my last chance, Wesley, really the last one. My instinct tells me I have to finish this. If there's something I've tried to teach you...
Person 2: It's to follow my instincts. And mine are telling me to get out of here.
Person 1: No, I've always said to follow 'my' instincts. Now we're going in there and finishing what we started. End of discussion.",245
"Person 1: Liz... I just wanted you to be happy. I dreamed of giving you the wedding and life you've always dreamed of... I love you so much...

Person 2: You and Moore need to get rid of the bodies and bury Boyd with them. And it would be best if Moore disappeared too.

Person 1: What?

Person 2: If you don't get rid of all the problems, it will never end.

Person 1: I can't...

Person 2: Either you take care of it, or don't come back.

Person 1: But...

Person 2: Do you really love me? Really?!",246
"Person 1: So do you want me to ask for directions or not? Because I'm already getting lost.  
Person 2: I wanted you to ask earlier, before we got lost.  
Person 1: I can never please you, can I?  
Person 2: Just admit that you made a mistake.  
Person 1: We all know how much you like that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. Happy?  
Person 2: Stop feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It's getting boring.  
Person 1: You know what's really boring? Constantly being reminded of what a failure I am whenever I mess up.  
Person 2: And here we go again – poor Tom.  
Person 1: But you know what, Liz? You're the one with a steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician. You have every right.  
Person 2: That's so unfair.  ",247
"Person 1: That woman you shot... she was my friend.
Person 2: Well, that's how it goes sometimes, right? Life can be brutal, but I guess no one said it would be otherwise. Don't they teach that in school? Maybe you should come to terms with it.",248
"Person 1: Listen, we need to talk...
Person 2: Ben, we're civilized people, right? Do we really need to intimidate each other?
Person 1: I'm not going to threaten you.
Person 2: Maybe you could lower your hands, okay? Thank you. You know, I can see in the dark. I've been here for a while.
Person 1: I just want to say that I have no personal grievances against you, Mr. Robinson. I have no complaints.
Person 2: But you probably don't respect me too much either, do you?
Person 1: No, I don't respect you.
Person 2: In that case, we don't have much to discuss, Ben. You should know the consequences of what you've done. My wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Person 1: But why?
Person 2: Why?
Person 1: It shouldn't matter what happened.
Person 2: That's quite a bold statement.
Person 1: Listen. What happened was meaningless. Like we just shook hands.
Person 2: Shook hands? That's not very nice for my wife, is it?
Person 1: You don't understand.
Person 2: Don't raise your voice, Ben.
Person 1: The point is, I don't love your wife. I love your daughter.
Person 2: Well, maybe you think so, Ben, but after a few times with Elaine in bed, you'd quickly get over it, just like...
Person 1: WHAT?
Person 2: I think I've said enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can accuse you, but I think I can. In light of what happened, I can put you behind bars if you look at my daughter again. I've talked to Elaine and spent the afternoon taking steps to ensure...",249
"Person 1: Argon, I swear, if you don't stop this disaster, this will be the last nanobot I ever construct. This is really your last chance!
Person 2: Susan, I don't think you realize the situation you're in. I'm ready to turn the whole city into jelly to achieve my goal. You'd better not stop me, because it will end tragically for you.",250
"Person 1: Curly, how much do you owe me?  
Person 2: Ah, Mr. Gittes, we're leaving tomorrow. I know you've been very patient, but my cousin Auggie is sick.  
Person 1: Don't worry about that. How about you pay off your debt by taking a few passengers to Ensenada? You'd have to leave tonight.  
Person 2: I'm not sure...  
Person 1: I can add an extra seventy-five dollars. Maybe even a round hundred.  
Person 2: Plus what I already owe you?  
Person 1: Yes, I'll add that too.  
Person 2: Alright, you've got your boat.",251
"Person 1: We've talked about this matter several times already!  
Person 2: I understand, but it's about the TruCoat...  
Person 1: I've told you, I don't want any TruCoat!  
Person 2: Yes, but without TruCoat, there might be oxidation problems. The repair will cost you much more than those five hundred zlotys.  
Person 1: Here we go again! We've already talked about this!  
Person 2: I know, but this TruCoat...  
Person 1: We agreed on a price of nineteen-five. You promised me I would get this car with these options, without any additional sealants, for nineteen-five!  
Person 2: Yes, I'm not saying you won't...  
Person 1: You called me twenty minutes ago and assured me that everything was ready for pickup. I came here for nothing, you're wasting my time and my wife's. I'm paying nineteen-five and not a penny more!  
Person 2: Okay, I'll talk to the boss...",252
"Person 1: George, I'm really glad to see you. How are you, brother?  
Person 2: We're not brothers anymore, Diego.  
Person 1: Of course we are. Why are you saying that? It really hurts, George.  
Person 2: You betrayed me, Diego.  
Person 1: No, I would never do that.  
Person 2: You cut me out of the business.  
Person 1: No, George, that's not true. I would never cheat you.  
Person 2: I talked to Foreal, Diego.",253
"Person 1: I feel like you're treating me like an old video player. As if you want to ""turn me on"" only when it suits you.  
Person 2: No, not at all! I'm just curious about how you see all of this. It's really interesting! Maybe you're exaggerating a bit?",254
"Person 1: You must say what I tell you to say.
Person 2: ""Salt Lake City, please. I don't speak English.""
Person 1: The driver will know what to do...
Person 2: But I do speak English.
Person 1: Please, do it my way. You might get into trouble if you don't cooperate. If someone asks you, just say: ""I don't speak English.""
Person 2: ""I don't speak English.""
Person 1: Exactly. In Omaha, the driver will help you get on the bus to Salt Lake City, and there a new driver will take care of the rest. When you reach Salt Lake City, tell the driver: ""Las Vegas, please.""
Person 2: ""Las Vegas, please. I don't speak English."" What is hitchhiking?
Person 1: You want this ticket, right?
Person 2: Yes, I do.
Person 1: So don't try to be clever, okay?",255
"Person 1: We don't need to do anything with him, everything is under control.  
Person 2: Do you think I'll let my share of fourteen million slip through my fingers because of this guy?  
Person 1: ""Your share?"" You must have slept through math class. There are three of us, so each gets one-third. That comes out to four and two-thirds million per person.  
Person 2: I'm just saying, this guy is trouble. And you brought him in, not me.  
Person 1: Exactly, Raoul. It was my idea, not yours. It's my family we're robbing, my grandfather built this room, I got the plans and found the safe. And it was my idea to ask a professional who builds such rooms for help. All of this is me, not you or ""Raoul,"" understand?  
Person 2: If he touches me again, I won't let it slide.  
Person 1: No, you won't do that, because without Burnham, we have no chance of opening the safe. So even if he annoys you, you have to put up with it, got it?  
Person 2: Don't talk to me in that tone, man.  
Person 1: Come on, what movie lines are you quoting? You're a bus driver from Flatbush, so don't try to be someone you're not. I saw the same movie as you.",256
"Person 1: You know I care about you... I really love you, Antoine.  
Person 2: I'm not Antoine, my name is Wally.  
Person 1: Maybe so, but how am I supposed to express my feelings for someone named Wally?",257
"Person 1: Look at yourself... Do you really want to go there?
Person 2: Why would I? For a few hundred bucks?
Person 1: I think you would do it even for free. You can see how much you like it. After all, you love adrenaline.
Person 2: It's my job. It's what I do.
Person 1: Why? Maybe you're trying to prove something to yourself?
Person 2: Are you suggesting I have something to prove?
Person 1: Don't you? Maybe it's suppressed anger?
Person 2: No, not like that.
Person 1: I'm just an average guy. I hate my job, and a career in adult films doesn't seem appealing.
Person 2: Every industry has its place in the world.
Person 1: Maybe so. But you... I feel like you could do anything. So why did you choose this?
Person 2: Because I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... It's my specialty.
Person 1: There's something else.
Person 2: Intuition. But that doesn't make me Yoda. Like tonight. I knew you would do what you did.
Person 1: So my role is just to smile and be on display?
Person 2: No. You have your role. You know what to do.
Person 1: How do you know I'll know?
Person 2: Intuition.",258
"Person 1: But you gave me a rose...
Person 2: And tomorrow I can give it to someone else. Get dressed and leave.
Person 1: How can you say that? Who are you really?
Person 2: I'm JP Monroe. And now, disappear from my life.
Person 1: I can't believe it! You pulled me in here...
Person 2: No one forced you.",259

Person 2: I want to go back upstairs. It's cold here and there are spiders everywhere. Besides, I'm hungry.  
Person 1: Pearl, listen to me carefully. We have to escape tonight, we have no other choice.  
Person 2: Why do we have to escape?  
Person 1: If we stay here, something really bad might happen. This is no joke.  
Person 2: What about Father Powell? Won't he protect us?  
Person 1: Unfortunately, no. He is not able to help us. We have to handle this ourselves.",260
"Person 1: Are you sure?  
Person 2: Really, I've heard it many times. Trust me, we'll manage. After all, that's what you asked me for, right?  
Person 1: But...  
Person 2: I know it's difficult, but you have to trust me. I'm here to help. I won't let you down, I promise.  
Person 1: Alright then...",261
"Person 1: Why are you in such a hurry? Did something happen?  
Person 2: No, everything is fine.  
Person 1: Really? Carrying so much cash in this area is madness. No wonder someone mugged you.  
Person 2: Thanks for your concern, but I have to go.  
Person 1: You won't get anywhere on that leg.  
Person 2: I have to! Listen, I work for the local mafia, dealing with slot machines in West Bend. I'm late with payments, and they think I'm cheating them. I have until four to deliver the money. If I don't, I'm in serious trouble.  
Person 1: The situation looks bad, it's ten to four.  
Person 2: I'll give you a hundred zlotys for you and your buddy if you take the money for me.  
Person 1: I don't know. That guy who got you is already mad at me. What if he's waiting around the corner with his friends?  
Person 2: He won't know you have the money. Please, help me.  
Person 1: Sorry, man. I can patch you up, call a doctor, but I can't risk it for you.  
Person 2: How about you? I'll give you the whole hundred!  
Person 1: How do you know you can trust him? He didn't do anything.",262
"Person 1: Marysia, I really didn't want to deceive you.
Person 2: Then why did you do it?
Person 1: Because I couldn't stop thinking about you. I knew that without you, my life would never be the same.",263
"Person 1: Son, that man is taking advantage of you, and you don't realize it. It's like you're standing on stage without any protection.
Person 2: I only see a jealous father who can't stand that his son has achieved greater success.
Person 1: It's not a matter of jealousy. To me, success is not just about money.
Person 2: Maybe that's why you never tried to step out of your comfort zone and strive for more.
Person 1: If you really think that, then maybe I truly failed to be the father I wanted to be.",264
"Person 1: Delacroix, wake up, man. The reason they didn't accept it is simple – no one, absolutely no one, regardless of skin color, wants to watch what you're proposing.

Person 2: I've never been given a real chance.

Person 1: You've got your head in the clouds with your Harvard education and snobbish manners. Man, I'm more authentic than you. I'm real, and you're just pretending, trying to be someone you're not.

Person 2: So I'm a traitor because I don't want to do something like ""Space Negro"" or ""The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer""? You think I'm like Tom? That I'm whiter than white, and you're blacker than black? Do you really think that?

Person 1: Exactly. I want you to create something that people actually want to watch. Let's be honest, most people in this country are like blind and deaf, including 35 million African Americans. You and I know that it's black people who set the trends, the style. This is a huge opportunity for us. These people need a guide.

Person 2: I'm not sure if I can give you what you're expecting.

Person 1: You will, or you'll be back at BET faster than you realize. I need a replacement mid-season, and I need it immediately. This is your fast track to success.",265
"Person 1: Do you think I'm doing this for myself? I'm doing all of this with you in mind!
Person 2: That's not true! It's all about you and your decisions! You always have to be right and control everyone as if we were your employees!
Person 1: I can't believe this!
Person 2: You're just trying to escape from Dad, and I'm just an excuse!
Person 1: That's not true! My issues with your father have nothing to do with this.
Person 2: Really? Do you think I don't see what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want a divorce, and Dad doesn't.
Person 1: Did he tell you that?
Person 2: He doesn't have to! It's obvious you can't stand him.
Person 1: That's not true!
Person 2: Then why do you want to leave?
Person 1: It's... it's not that simple. I know you think it is, but it's complicated. I don't even know what I want. I don't have all the answers.
Person 2: You just pretend you do.",266
"Person 1: Arletta, you know that not everything is as it seems. Everyone must follow their own path, there is no other way.  
Person 2: I don't know, maybe I should distance myself from this. I can only love you and let you go.",267
"Person 1: Ben...
Person 2: Oh, you remember my name. Maybe you also remember what you promised?
Person 1: We're doing what we can...
Person 2: Sure, sure. Victor said it would be like this.",268
"Person 1: Really, you should be careful and not trust anyone. It might be worth considering some protection, you know, just in case.  
Person 2: But I can trust Rheia, right?  
Person 1: Don't be naive. You don't want to end up like me.  
Person 2: But you're not Gibarian...  
Person 1: Oh, really? And who do you think I am?  
Person 2: Someone who lets themselves be manipulated.  
Person 1: Maybe you're the one being manipulated. Like a puppet that believes it's a human. It's funny, isn't it? Puppets often think they're real.",269
"Person 1: Our relationship used to be based on love. Now I feel like a prisoner in a cage, under constant pressure.  
Person 2: Everything changes. Besides, you gave up on that love yourself when you first cheated on me with Maxine.  
Person 1: You were the one who first got infatuated with her.  
Person 2: Yes, but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.  
Person 1: You didn't do anything because you knew she would reject you anyway.  
Person 2: That's true. Oh God, Lotte, what has happened to me? My wife feels like she's in a cage, and I'm the one keeping her there. I've betrayed our trust.  
Person 1: Maybe you were always like this, Craig, you just never faced it.  
Person 2: Maybe you're right. But I can't lose you. Too much has happened. You're my only support.  
Person 1: I need to think about all of this.  
Person 2: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I feel like a monster. Like someone you read about in the newspapers and think, ""what kind of person.""

Person 2: I already told you. He tried to contact me. If you had seen his face... He looked like he really wanted to tell me something. I feel like I have to help him.  
Person 1: I'm not sure...  
Person 2: Listen, if we do nothing, it could end badly for him, and we have a chance to prevent something really bad. It's McDermott, I know he would do the same.

"Person 1: I've never met anyone like you, Betty.  
Person 2: I know, that's why we're meant for each other...  
Person 1: No, I mean, your devotion kind of scares me...  
Person 2: It's easy to be devoted when you really care about someone...  
Person 1: Yes, I thought so too at first, but now... the hours, the monotony... It's not the same as the glamour and gallery openings. Maybe I should have listened to people earlier and tried night shifts, I don't know... I just hope it's not too late for me. God, listen to me, I'm always talking about myself. Enough of that, right? No more about me today, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think of me? Just kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm always the one talking...  
Person 2: ...but I love listening to you, so it's really not a problem...  
Person 1: Thanks. But I'd like to know how you feel...  
Person 2: Well, I think life will be much better for you now that I'm around. I promise...  
Person 1: You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that suddenly came into my life... I said that once to Leslie, at her funeral, remember?...

Person 2: Shut up, will you? Are you sure? There was no one there?
Person 1: Duffy! Duffy! Where is Duffy? Diabetes! I should have known not to hire anyone with a condition. Louie.",273
"Person 1: Wait, I'm not crazy. You know, when I was little, my mom let me make toffee in the kitchen. When I finished, she said, ""Go and share it with the other kids."" I agreed, but I thought, ""Does she really think I'm that naive?"" Still, I wanted others to try it and see how good it was, so I gave it all away. And you know what? I didn't mind because I made it. You see, sometimes you need other people, an audience, to appreciate your work. Doesn't that sound a bit strange?
Person 2: Not really, but I guess I'm not a confectioner. How would you describe my situation?
Person 1: Look at it this way: that girl is a bit clever, right?
Person 2: Really?
Person 1: Of course. Imagine she's a sly girl from Liverpool. Hey, mate, you're trying to trick me, aren't you? Two colas and a pack of cheese chips, and then love? And suddenly we stop in an empty shop. You just want my body, but you won't get it... and that's it!
Person 2: Do you think that's what she meant?
Person 1: Sure, it's obvious from a mile away. She's trying to push him into marriage, but he doesn't want to... you know, no guy wants to get married. But girls, they're clever and cunning. You have to laugh about it.",274
"Beth: There's something wrong with you, Norman. Get a grip.

Norman: Get a grip? What are you talking about?

Beth: You're lying...

Norman: Lying? Are you absolutely sure about that? Then explain those jellyfish we saw earlier. Harry isn't afraid of them, but you are. That's your fear, isn't it?

Norman: But...

Beth: And snakes? Do you want to talk about snakes? You saw one outside, didn't you? When you thought I left you, you were terrified.

Norman: That's when you entered the sphere.

Beth: Yes, one lone sea snake. You created it, Norman.

Norman: Really? Maybe it was you? When you were hiding in the bathroom, you were scared, right? You were terrified, just like with that snake, and suddenly there were snakes crawling everywhere. You did that, Norman.

Norman: You're crazy.

Beth: Crazy? Or maybe I'm making so much sense that it's driving you crazy?

Norman: I never entered that sphere.

Beth: You don't remember entering it. But you do remember running for Harry, right? You remember that.

Norman: Yes.

Beth: You remember looking at the sphere before you picked him up when it opened? But you don't remember going inside, do you? Harry couldn't remember either, right? ""Like it's all on the tip of your tongue,"" he said.

Norman: That's nonsense.

Beth: Really?

Norman: Beth, the message was ""Harry."" ""My name is Harry."" My name isn't Harry.

Beth: No, it's not. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother... what was his name? The one who was stung by a jellyfish when you were kids. The one you couldn't save. What was his name? ""Mom, we're going to the ocean to swim."" ""But I don't want to swim, Norman. I'm scared."" ""Come on, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."" You heartless bastard. That's why you're afraid of the water, isn't it?

Norman: Stop, Beth...

Beth: When you were in that submarine and the squid attacked you... are you sure it was a squid attacking you? ""I can't reach Beth on the radio. I'm in this little boat at the bottom of the ocean. Completely alone. Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really a squid attacking you, Norman, or was it something else, one of your fears? You never really saw what it was, did you?",275
"Person 1: You know what the future is? Renovation, automation, and computerization. That's the key to success. Look at this screen. Do you see that little girl playing bowling? Her ball barely rolls, but thanks to technology, boom! The pins fall as if by magic. And look how happy she is.

Person 2: What happened to regular bowling?

Person 1: The world is changing, the competition in entertainment is huge. You have to adapt to survive.

Person 2: But I like bowling the way it is.

Person 1: You know, you have something special in you. You have such determination that you can achieve wonders. Maybe that's why fate put you in my path. I think I could help you, Theo.

Person 2: How could you help me, Mr. Kastle?

Person 1: You need a sponsor, and I have the right contacts. I can support you.

Person 2: Why would you want to help me?

Person 1: Because I like you, Theo. You see, you play bowling with true passion.",276
"Person 1: You know, over time, things like this become easier. Eventually, you'll stop thinking about it, and all those doubts will disappear. Believe me, it's just a matter of time.
Person 2: Do you really think so?",277
"Person 1: I understand now what it's about. This can really help. I can convince others to understand your situation.
Person 2: Okay...
Person 1: Let me take it.
Person 2: No way! Then you'll all accuse me!
Person 1: If you don't let me in, then take it outside.
Person 2: As soon as I come out, you'll shoot me!
Person 1: Dennis, you managed to do the right thing once before; do it again. If you save his life, it might help you in court.",278
"Person 1: What time is it?  
Person 2: Don't worry, we have the whole night ahead of us.  
Person 1: The maid saw us. She might have noticed and remembered us.  
Person 2: Do you still want to go home, Honey?  
Person 1: No.  
Person 2: Then calm down and don't worry so much.",279
"Person 1: What happened?  
Person 2: Do you remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? I hit something near its front fender. I was looking right instead of left.  
Person 1: Well, well, so you're not that clever after all. You should know that if something happened to you, I would consider using an egg from a bank. Actually, I would prefer to use a donor.  
Person 2: But you know, then the child wouldn't have your nose. How perfect does your child have to be?  
Person 1: You hypocrite. Do you think you would have achieved all this if you didn't have such genes and resources? Aren't you pleased with the thought that your children can live long and happily, as long as they don't do something stupid?  
Person 2: That's exactly what worries me — that they won't do anything stupid, or brave, or anything that truly matters.",280
"Person 1: How is it possible that you have such power?  
Person 2: That power has always been within you.  
Person 1: I feel immense relief. How can I repay you for this?  
Person 2: Join me on my mission.  
Person 1: And what exactly are you looking for?  
Person 2: The same thing all people have always desired - complete knowledge. But for that, we need a spaceship.  
Person 1: A spaceship? There are no ships on Nimbus III.  
Person 2: I know a way to get one.  
Person 1: But how is that possible?  
Person 2: Trust me, my friend. There are more of us than you think.",281
"Person 1: Are we really talking about an amount between 50 and 400 million?  
Person 2: Yes, exactly.  
Person 1: And if you had to guess, where do you think we'll end up?  
Person 2: Without a connection to headquarters, I'd bet closer to the lower end. But that's still a huge sum.  
Person 1: Why would PG&E agree to this?  
Person 2: They know what's coming. They know they'd lose in court. Maybe they won't lose the entire 400 million, but if you add up the costs over ten years, it makes sense...  
Person 1: What ten years?  
Person 2: The trial could take five years, and then another five for the appeal.  
Person 1: Are you saying that if this goes to court, it will be ten years before these people get any money?  
Person 2: It's not that bad. Look at Love Canal — it's been twenty years, and those people still haven't gotten anything. In legal terms, ten years is...  
Person 1: Forget legal terms. We're talking about people. Sick people. Many of them won't live another ten years. They need the money now! We have to convince them to go to arbitration, Ed. We have to convince each of them to...  
Person 2: I know. We have a meeting, everything is already planned...  
Person 1: When and where?  
Person 2: Tuesday at seven, at the firehouse in Hinkley.  
Person 1: Good. I should tell them because they trust me more than...  
Person 2: You can't be there.  
Person 1: Of course I will. I don't care what the doctor says...  
Person 2: It's not the doctor's advice. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come.  
Person 1: Why not?  
Person 2: Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're unpredictable.  
Person 1: Forget about Kurt.  
Person 2: Erin...  
Person 1: No, I'm serious. Do you know who Kurt Potter is? He's the guy who would never have taken this case. He's someone who would sell these people out if PG&E offered 20 million. He doesn't operate like we do, Ed. He doesn't have that inner voice telling him to do what's right.",282
"Person 1: Do you think I'm wrong?
Person 2: Really? Would you be willing to fabricate evidence to accuse someone you are convinced is guilty? Answer only ""yes"" or ""no.""
Person 1: Dudley, we've already talked about this.
Person 2: Please, answer clearly. Yes or no?
Person 1: No, I wouldn't do that.
Person 2: Would you manipulate crime scene evidence to support the prosecutor's hypothesis? Answer me, Edmund.
Person 1: No, I wouldn't do that.
Person 2: Would you force a suspect to testify, knowing they are guilty?
Person 1: No.
Person 2: Would you shoot a criminal to minimize risk?
Person 1: No, I wouldn't do that.
Person 2: For heaven's sake, maybe you shouldn't be a detective. Maybe it's better for you to stick to tasks where you don't have to make such decisions. Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
Person 1: I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't have to act like you. Or like my father.
Person 2: At least get rid of those glasses. I don't know anyone in the Bureau who wears them.",283
"Person 1: I think I would prefer to just pass it on.  
Person 2: I understand, but I really care about us moving forward with this project. I can offer you money, so you don't have to worry about repayment; you can just borrow it.  
Person 1: I need two hundred fifty thousand.  
Person 2: You know, for us to continue our collaboration, I think you need five hundred thousand. That will help us achieve our goals.",284
"Person 1: There was another phone call. From your agent. He said the summer deal is already sorted out. So you're going back east, right?
Person 2: ...Yes.
Person 1: Without me.
Person 2: I guess we're breaking up.
Person 1: You weren't going to tell me about it? You just wanted to pack up and leave?
Person 2: Dick, we need some time apart...
Person 1: I'm not stupid, you know? I see you're pulling away from me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn around and say everything is fine.
Person 2: Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Person 1: Now I'm Dwayne! And you better get used to it!
Person 2: Dick...
Person 1: Did you think that maybe I also want to leave? Maybe I also want to do theater? But no, because you don't want me with you, right? And it's not about the summer season.
Person 2: No?
Person 1: No. It's about that night, right?
Person 2: What night?
Person 1: The premiere. I never pressed you about it, but now I want to know what happened then and where the hell you were!
Person 2: Do you want to know his name?",285
"Person 1: I'm sorry, I really thought it would be a good idea.
Person 2: Janek, stop with the excuses already! We're here, we have nothing, and time is running out. We need to act. There's no turning back, so let's get to work and start brainstorming!",286
"Person 1: ""Do you really think you have the right to judge others? You? You're not in a position to criticize or approve of anything, as they say in your circles. You're nobody. You're like wallpaper on the wall. You didn't come here to make friends. You start asking about someone's place of residence. Who told you about the 'Red Dragon'?""
Person 2: ""I understand, I'm sorry.""
Person 1: ""And now this Brit is upset and wants to change everything for me. Max will go crazy when he finds out about this... I need to call him before he hears it from someone else.""",287
"Person 1: I have a great idea, what do you say to a gondola ride?  
Person 2: The one that goes underwater?  
Person 1: Yes, exactly! It's a really amazing experience!  
Person 2: No, Kelly, I'm not in the mood for that...  
Person 1: Oh, come on, it will be great! It's really worth it!  
Person 2: Not for me. You know I don't like water.  
Person 1: But you won't be in the water, you'll be in the gondola. It's completely different!  
Person 2: Maybe you can think of something else?  
Person 1: Sean, this is really absurd. You're acting like a child.  
Person 2: Not at all. I just don't want to go there, okay?",288
"Person 1: I can't believe you told the boss I was late because I overslept!
Person 2: Oh, don't exaggerate. I just mentioned that you had a rough morning.
Person 1: It sounded like you undermined me.
Person 2: You're making a bigger deal out of this than it's worth. Just relax a bit!",289
"Person 1: It really hurt when you laughed at my presentation in front of everyone.  
Person 2: I've already apologized. Why do you keep bringing it up?  
Person 1: Because I feel like your apology wasn't sincere.  
Person 2: If you can't accept my apology, that's not my fault. Maybe you're the one with the problem.  
Person 1: I just want to feel respected and appreciated.  
Person 2: I feel like you can't move on.",290
"Person 1: I heard that last year you were spreading rumors about me.
Person 2: Why are you bringing this up now? It was a long time ago. There's no point in digging it up.
Person 1: Just because it was a long time ago doesn't mean it didn't hurt me.
Person 2: Constantly going back to old issues won't help. It's better to focus on what's happening now instead of living in the past.",291
"Person 1: What do you mean?  
Person 2: You know, did you let him kiss you?  
Person 1: Yes, of course. That's normal.  
Person 2: I'm not judging. But... did you go further?  
Person 1: Just a little.  
Person 2: How much further?  
Person 1: Dad! That's really none of your business!  
Person 2: I'm asking because it's really important.  
Person 1: Not much further.

"Person 1: Wade, you're finished. Give me the keys to the store.  
Person 2: Don't you understand? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jack, don't you see that?  
Person 1: The key, Wade.  
Person 2: Of course, you can have the key. It's what kept me with you all these years. I'm giving it back with pleasure. Now I'm free. See, Jack, how simple it is? Just give back what he gave you, and you're free from him. I need to call my brother.",293
"Person 1: Were you close with that guy?  
Person 2: Yes, I know him well, so I know he liked it...  
Person 1: But you said you were only with three guys! You never mentioned him!  
Person 2: Because we were never in a full relationship!  
Person 1: But you were still close with him!  
Person 2: We met a few times. We didn't go all the way, but there was something more between us.  
Person 1: I can't believe it! Why did you say you were only with three guys?  
Person 2: Because it's true when it comes to full relationships! But that doesn't mean I didn't have other connections.  
Person 1: I feel really bad about this...  
Person 2: I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.  
Person 1: I thought I understood! You only talked about three guys.  
Person 2: Please, try to calm down.  
Person 1: How many were there?  
Person 2: Dante...  
Person 1: How many people were you that close with?  
Person 2: We don't have to dwell on this...  
Person 1: Tell me, how many?!  
Person 2: Fine, give me a moment, and I'll tell you! For heaven's sake! I wasn't this upset when you told me about your past relationships.  
Person 1: That's different. This is important to me. How many?!  ",294
"Person 1: What's happening? What went on here?
Person 2: Nothing happened, leave me alone.
Person 1: Stanley, don't try to brush me off. As the coordinator of this program, I need to know what's going on. Answer my questions, okay?",295
"Person 1: Well, it's smudged again. Isn't that interesting?  
Person 2: I knew it would interest you. I want you to be involved in this project, Ania. Not just in the finished product, but in the whole process of creating the book.  
Person 1: Thanks for thinking of me. Can I bring you something from town? Do you need anything specific? A voice recorder? Or maybe some slippers to make writing more comfortable for you?  
Person 2: No, just paper will do.  
Person 1: Are you sure? Because if you want, I can bring you the whole store.  
Person 2: Ania, what's going on?  
Person 1: What's going on? Let me tell you. I'm doing my best to make you happy. I cook, clean, take care of you. And what do I get in return? ""You chose the wrong paper, Ania. I can't write on it."" I'll buy you that paper, but I expect a bit more gratitude, Mr. Writer.",296

Person 2: Calm down, Walter, don't get so worked up.  
Person 1: It's always about staying calm, Dude. But look where that's gotten us—this whole pacifism thing doesn't work. Look at the situation in Iraq—pacifism isn't the solution.  
Person 2: Come on, man, chill out.  
Person 1: I'm completely calm, Dude.  
Person 2: Oh yeah? Waving a gun around?!  
Person 1: I'm calmer than you are.",297

Person 2: ""You better watch your words, because I can show you what respect means.""

Person 2: Maybe we should undress?
Person 1: Sounds good.",302
"Person 1: I can't believe you looked through my phone without asking!  
Person 2: I was just looking for the number to the restaurant. You're overreacting, it's really not a big deal.  
Person 1: It's about my privacy, Sophie.  
Person 2: Seriously, you're making a drama out of this. I didn't have any bad intentions.  
Person 1: It still violates my boundaries, and I want you to respect that.",303
"Person 1: She really needs a family, someone who will be like a father to her. I can give her what you never had.

"Person 1: You mentioned that mysterious voice. What exactly did you see? Was it just part of this figure, or the whole thing?  
Person 2: I saw his face.  
Person 1: Did he have hair?  
Person 2: Yes, he did.  
Person 1: Was it long and flowing?  
Person 2: Honestly, I'm more interested in what he was saying than his appearance.  
Person 1: But if someone took on the form of a saint, an angel, or an ordinary person, how would you recognize him? Just by the words?  
Person 2: Maybe we should move on to the next question.  
Person 1: Enough of this! You must answer the question... otherwise, there will be consequences!",305
"Person 1: I didn't break any laws.
Person 2: Oh, but you did. You lied to us, and that can be considered obstruction of justice. Your silence might have contributed to someone's death, so we can charge you with endangerment. And as for your cows, PETA will certainly not be happy with how you treat them.
Person 1: I lied because if I told the truth, you would have used it to do something bad, which is exactly what you're doing now.",306
"Person 1: Stop for a moment and think. You'll do it for me, right?  
Person 2: Okay, I'll think.  
Person 1: No, you're not thinking. You're too busy being a smart aleck to really consider it. I want you to stop and start thinking. Can you do that for me?

Person 1: Imagine there's a wagon. How many drivers does a wagon have?  
Person 2: One.  
Person 1: Let's say I'm driving, and you change your attitude and ride with me.  
Person 2: Okay.  
Person 1: I know a few things. I know you've had a tough day. Maybe you think I don't know the details, but I know everything. Problems with being kicked out of the movie, the heartbreak when you see your wife with someone else... losing access to that precious film collection...",307
"Person 1: Are you Anya Rosson? I heard about you back in New York.  
Person 2: I'm sorry, but I don't recognize you.

Person 1: So what? In this town, anyone who wears cowboy boots is either a commissioner or related to one. I'm thoroughly fed up with it.  
Person 2: This is his turf. His uncle is the chief judge, and his brother-in-law runs the county commission. I don't know how many more relatives he has here. We need to find a way to bring him back somehow.  
Person 1: Phil, I understand you're looking at this from a financial perspective, but you're not down here where I am. I have thousands of players and five hundred dealers. They're all just waiting for a chance to cheat me. I need to show that I have everything under control, that nothing escapes me.",309

Person 2: Have you done something like this before?  
Person 1: Listen, let's forget about all the horror and moral dilemmas for a moment. What do we have left? Just 52 kilograms to move from point A to point B. The simplest path is a straight line, but we have to act discreetly. I see that line. Trust me, Adam. Trust me... I can handle it.",310

**Person 1:** No, you're his wife.

**Person 2:** You're not the one sleeping with him. I have to. I can't even breathe without his permission. He keeps me like in a cage. If he thinks I looked at someone the wrong way, he makes me his punching bag. He doesn't trust anyone. If he saw us together now, you'd be in trouble – believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I want to enjoy life. I love Jake, but you don't know how he can be. Sometimes I'm scared.

**Person 1:** Try to understand, Vickie. Jake has a lot on his mind. He's been at the top for a long time.

**Person 2:** Of course, defend him. You're his brother. He'll never be a champion. Too many people are against him.

"Person 1: I'm not sure... I was wondering...
Person 2: Do you really think that God cannot convey His words Himself?
Person 1: I don't know... Please... Tell me it's not true...
Person 2: Who are you to decide your own fate?
Person 1: I... really don't know... What do you expect from me?
Person 2: Nothing specific. I'm here to help you find freedom...",316
"Person 1: Eduardo, do you really want to leave this place? I think you have great conditions here. It's the best you can have for a long time. Don't waste it, because you might regret it later.

Person 2: I run an honest business. I have fishing boats, I catch tuna. You can check it. I have all the tax documents, everything is in order...

Person 1: Come on, you tried to kill me, and now you're pretending to be innocent.

Person 2: You can't come at me like this here. I want to talk to my lawyer.

Person 1: With the amount of coke we have on you, in some places, you're even facing the death penalty. Think carefully about what you're going to do.",317
"Person 1: Tracy, you are a really intelligent girl with many admirable qualities. But maybe one day you will understand that just being smart and striving for success, even at the expense of others, is not everything in life. In the end, you are deceiving yourself.

Person 2: Why are you lecturing me?

Person 1: Maybe this is not the best time for such conversations, but you know, there was once someone who made a huge mistake in life. I think it shows how our actions can have serious consequences. You are still young, Tracy, but one day you will understand.

Person 2: I don't know what you're talking about, but I know one thing: if some older people, who should be wiser, didn't behave like children, everything would be fine.

Person 1: I agree. But I also think that young and naive people should be grateful that certain indiscretions of theirs have not become public and ruined their reputations, especially before important decisions.

Person 2: And I think that older people, like you and your ""colleague,"" should not desire their students. And they certainly shouldn't spread slanderous accusations, especially when the mothers of these young people work as secretaries in the largest law firm in the city and have many won cases to their credit. If you want to continue questioning me, I will not proceed without my lawyer present.",318
"Person 1: Is that what you mean?  
Person 2: Yes, and you don't have to be sarcastic. What she's doing is truly beautiful. Some people do more than just go to the hairdresser and shop at expensive stores.  
Person 1: Lester, you're pathetic. You don't help anyone. You just force people to give money to a bunch of selfish individuals who only think about themselves. It's just business, don't kid yourself. And do you know what's the worst part? Even if someone benefits from it, which I can't imagine, you'll never know about it. You're just exhausting yourself and deceiving yourself. And if you think your new partner will leave that girl alone, or that she'll leave him, you're mistaken.  
Person 2: What are you talking about?  
Person 1: Think about it, Lester, if you still have time.",319
"Person 1: Look, this address: 2753. This is probably the place we were looking for, right?  
Person 2: Yeah, great...  
Person 1: What do you mean? It looks quite ordinary... What don't you like about it?  
Person 2: I said ""great""...  
Person 1: Yes, I can see how much you like it...  
Person 2: What am I supposed to say? ""I can't wait to live in some depressing hole at the end of the world""?  
Person 1: There's always something you don't like about every place we look at! Maybe just say outright that you don't want to live with me?  
Person 2: I'm afraid that if I do, you'll make a scene and start acting crazy.",320
"Person 1: When I thought about you, I mostly felt hatred. Where have you been?  
Person 2: I wasn't hiding. I was in custody. They're looking for Freddie's murderer.  
Person 1: You must be joking.  
Person 2: They gave me a pass, that's why I'm in this outfit. That's why you haven't heard anything about me.  
Person 1: You know, everyone thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.  
Person 2: I know. Listen, I can't talk now. We'll talk later, okay?",321
"Person 1: I feel like I can't focus.  
Person 2: Don't worry, you don't have to think about it right now.  
Person 1: But we need to talk about money...  
Person 2: You know, I'm actually close to getting a reward.  
Person 1: A reward? What kind of reward?  
Person 2: I'll tell you about it later, it's quite complicated.  
Person 1: What's the reward for?  
Person 2: The museum director went missing and...  
Person 1: So what?  
Person 2: They're offering a reward for information.  
Person 1: But you haven't found him yet.  
Person 2: Is this an interrogation, or are you my wife?  
Person 1: You went to America supposedly on vacation...  
Person 2: I was working there, don't be unfair.  
Person 1: Please, be honest.  
Person 2: I swear I'm telling the truth.  
Person 1: I want to talk about your promotion and salary, because I can't...  
Person 2: Promotion? What exactly do you want to talk about?  
Person 1: About your salary, because it's really important.",322
"Person 1: You both have gone crazy, really.  
Person 2: It's called having a psychological advantage.  
Person 1: You'll never succeed, seriously.  
Person 2: Trust me, it's already settled.",323
"Person 1: I really wish you would quit this job...
Person 2: Mom, please, let's not start this again...
Person 1: You could teach... That would be better for you...
Person 2: I'm not planning to quit now...
Person 1: You're everything I have... I get scared when you go into the water... It really frightens me...",324
"Person 1: Honey, I just found out. Are you okay?  
Person 2: Yes, everything's fine. I'm just hot.  
Person 1: Mrs. H mentioned that she thought you might be...  
Person 2: No, I'm not pregnant. I'm just too warm.  
Person 1: I understand.  
Person 2: Aren't you hot?  
Person 1: I'm all sweaty. Come on, I'll take you home.  
Person 2: Can we really not go back home? I can't breathe here. Don't you miss the greenery, the rain? Wouldn't you like to feel the rain on your face? It's Christmas, and everything here is so... different. If only you wanted, we could go back tomorrow.  
Person 1: Darling, you know we can't go back now; a war might break out.  
Person 2: Geoffrey, you're always coming up with something.  
Person 1: I love you. What smells so nice?  
Person 2: What?  
Person 1: Marzipan! I think you have marzipan in your hair. No wonder you miss home.",325
"Person 1: You know, you often say in class that good writers make conscious choices. And don't get me wrong, your book is really great. But sometimes it seems like it's too detailed, with all that horse pedigree and other minutiae. I might be wrong, but sometimes it looks like you... didn't think everything through completely. I wonder if it would be different if you wrote sober.

Person 2: I understand what you mean, but I'll surprise you — I'm not the first writer to occasionally reach for something to relax. And by the way, one of my books, which I wrote in just such a state, won the PEN award. And yes, I accepted it while also slightly tipsy.",326
"Person 1: Oh God, tell me, what's his name!
Person 2: It's... Charlie M.
Person 1: Charlie M? Really? I have to hurt you to protect this guy? Charlie M? You fool!
Person 2: Do what you want, kill me if you have to.
Person 1: Kill you? Don't be ridiculous. Frankie, help him understand the situation.",327
"Person 1: Take it away from here!
Person 2: Kiki, it won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Person 1: That doesn't matter. Take it away!
Person 2: Listen, Kiki, I have a brilliant idea...
Person 1: I assume it involves me.
Person 2: I thought it wouldn't be enough for you to just walk onto the stage. I want your entrance to be unforgettable!
Person 1: On its back, I guess.
Person 2: No, that's too cliché. Lead it in on a leash.
Person 1: You're really generous.
Person 2: Kiki, have I ever let you down?
Person 1: Not yet.
Person 2: And I never will. We're a great duo. But the competition is serious.
Person 1: Clo-Clo?
Person 2: Imagine bringing this kitten onto the stage right in the middle of her performance. That would be something!",328
"Person 1: You know, triangular relationships rarely work out.
Person 2: What are you talking about?
Person 1: Kelly, I've been working in the police for years. It's hard enough to keep a secret between two people, let alone three. And what about feelings? Do you really want that guy, who has his own issues, hanging around you and Sam, especially now that you have money?",329
"Person 1: Don't you think you should be with me? It's logical, after all.
Person 2: What if I give you a son who then wants to take over everything and get rid of you? That might not be the best plan.",330
"Person 1: I've thought it over. I'll give it to you, but only after I receive the inheritance. You can take that copy if you want, but there's another one.
Person 2: That wasn't part of our agreement.
Person 1: Well, you can sue me if you want. The situation has changed. I think you should go home. After you leave, I see no reason for us to stay in contact.
Person 2: I'm not leaving here without that tape.
Person 1: Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my patience and send it out of sheer spite.",331
"Person 1: This story is unbelievable, which is perfect for us. It's free publicity that will last for months.

Person 2: I don't think she'll manage. Did you see what happened?

Person 1: You're the one who messed up. Who wouldn't be stressed in that situation? And I don't care what problems she has. She wouldn't be the first in this crew with issues. We lose nothing by offering her cooperation.

Person 2: And what about me? Don't you want to know what I think about it? It's me...

Person 1: Why should I care what you think? By the way, I have some news for you. I loved your idea with the 'icy water' recently... I'm thinking about killing off David Ravell in a boating accident.

Person 2: That's not a bad idea. How many episodes will it be before he comes back?",332
"Person 1: These are the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since your husband's death --
Person 2: Murder.
Person 1: -- a serious question arises concerning --
Person 2: These are my children. And there is no doubt about it.
Person 1: Sometimes, Mrs. Little, honesty is the best form of kindness. All your children are causing problems, and Malcolm is even a thief.
Person 2: Please leave.
Person 1: Your control over the children is questionable, which is why --
Person 2: Did you hear me?
Person 1: You will regret it, Mrs. Little, if you don't listen.
Person 2: If you don't leave immediately, you won't have anything to regret.",333
"Person 1: The only way to teach them discipline is to use force! Everyone should get fifty lashes!  
Person 2: Sir, Congress hasn't paid them for two months, and many of them haven't had a decent meal in a long time. Isn't that too harsh?  
Person 1: Nathanael, someone born into the right environment, who is a true gentleman – unlike them – always puts duty above basic needs.  
Person 2: Well, sir, I was a blacksmith before you hired me. Maybe I'll disappoint you yet.",334
"Person 1: I can argue with you about this topic.
Person 2: You can, but if you don't sign now, this agreement will start to fall apart. You will lose all the benefits, opportunities will disappear, and your salary will decrease. Do you really want to risk that?",335
"Person 1: And what about his wife? Do you have anything on her?  
Person 2: We don't have anything on her.  
Person 1: And the kids? Did you check?  
Person 2: The kids are fine.  
Person 1: No one has perfect kids, that's impossible.  
Person 2: Really, we have nothing, Bob. This isn't going to work.  
Person 1: If we don't find anything, we'll make something up. Instead of a few weeks, we'll stretch it out to a few months. We've got this under control.  
Person 2: Do you seriously think we can drag this out for a few months?!",336
"Person 1: What are you doing, Janek?! Have you gone mad?!
Person 2: I haven't done anything.
Person 1: Really? Do you think I'll believe that?
Person 2: I just went out for a walk. It's no big deal.
Person 1: Not true! There are rules in this house, and you have to follow them, whether you like it or not!
Person 2: And if I don't? What will you do, shoot me?
Person 1: I don't rule out that option.
Person 2: Maybe if you let me live in the dorm, I wouldn't have to sneak out to meet my friends.
Person 1: Oh, so now it's all my fault?
Person 2: Okay, never mind...",337
"Person 1: Mookie, I've always respected you. You may not be the sharpest, but you're honest. Don't make me change my mind.  
Person 2: Sal, I want my money.  
Person 1: Don't even mention it. Your paycheck won't even cover the cost of that window you broke.  
Person 2: Forget the window, Radio Raheem is dead.  
Person 1: You're right, the boy is dead, but Mook, this isn't a good time for such talks.  
Person 2: This is exactly the right time. I know I'm sorry about Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I have to live too. I need my paycheck.  
Person 1: We all need money.  
Person 2: We know you'll get insurance compensation! You know the rules.  
Person 1: Really?  
Person 2: Stop stalling.  
Person 1: You have no idea what you're talking about.",338
"Person 1: Maybe you should get a pedicure while you're there? Is that some kind of tracking device?  
Person 2: No matter where you hide, I'll find you. You have nowhere to run. And if you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject you with so much curare that you won't even realize it before it's over for you. Do you understand?  
Person 1: I understand, either I spy or there's no hope for me.",339
"Person 1: No music. I'm preparing for the crossing. It's time for shield training.  
Person 2: Shield training? Gurney, we already had training this morning... I really don't feel like it.  
Person 1: Don't feel like it? Desire is a good thing for entertainment, but not for combat.  
Person 2: I'm sorry, Gurney.  
Person 1: Just ""sorry"" isn't enough.",340
"Person 1: I'm sorry if you felt uncomfortable or upset...
Person 2: Yes, that's exactly how it was.
Person 1: I'm really sorry. I didn't mean for that to happen. I just had to see you.
Person 2: You'd think someone who saves the world would have more important things to do than chase after some girl.
Person 1: I can't stop thinking about you, it's stronger than me.
Person 2: Maybe you should get out of the house more often.
Person 1: Come on, I have to show you something.",341
"Person 1: Weronika, I'm so excited! Everyone has signed this petition, even those who think BigFun is just hopeless eurodisco. I can't believe you haven't signed it yet!

Person 2: Maybe others adore you, but I know you. Jennifer Forbes said she signed the petition because it was about installing a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...

Person 1: Well, you know, some people need a bit of different ""convincing"" than others... Come on, just sign the petition!

Person 2: Don't talk to me like that.

Person 1: It was J.D.'s idea! He prepared the signature list and everything. Will you sign now?

Person 2: No.

Person 1: What, are you jealous?",342
"Person 1: Bill, I need to talk to you...
Person 2: Bernie, don't even start. Didn't I tell you that one more word and you'll lose your job?
Person 1: It's about...
Person 2: I know what you're going to say. Another excuse, right? I have a whole list of your excuses written down. I've heard them all.
Person 1: Bill, I have serious legal problems...
Person 2: Enough! You've already spoken. You're fired. Pack up and leave.
Person 1: Bill, please, listen...
Person 2: No, Bernie. I told you. We have clients waiting, and you want to just walk out? Meet people in this state?
Person 1: Bill, I really have financial problems...
Person 2: I don't care about your problems. I have my own, and you're one of them. Please leave.",343
"Person 1: Do you want to stir things up a bit and start a new rumor?  
Person 2: Do you really think I have a hidden agenda by being with you?  
Person 1: You tell me if that's the case.  
Person 2: It seems to me that you need help. Has anyone ever told you that before?  
Person 1: Please, answer my question, Patryk.  
Person 2: I don't gain anything from this. I simply enjoy your company.",344
"Person 1: You know, when I first met you, you seemed like a weirdo to me... And I still think that, but now you're my weirdo.  
Person 2: Sure... So, are we doing this or not? I haven't packed yet.  
Person 1: Why are you being so grumpy? This is an important night for us...  
Person 2: Adam, darling. We had an arrangement, it was just a physical relationship, and now...  
Person 1: But that was before we started sharing real experiences. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that.  
Person 2: Peepers was your... dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't even listening.  
Person 1: That doesn't make me feel better at all! Why are you being so cruel?  
Person 2: Don't yell at me – I gave you what many dream of – no-strings-attached sex. Don't pretend there was more between us than physicality.  
Person 1: Stop, stop, you devilish woman!",345
"Person 1: Why are you forcing me to do this?  
Person 2: Maya, I know it's difficult, but you'll understand when you meet him. I really need your support; I can't manage without you.",346
"Person 1: You should be glad I'm even here. I'm telling you, Jimmy, I can barely stand it.  
Person 2: Stop complaining! Four years ago, when I first met you on the ship, you were acting the same way, right?  
Person 1: Well, yes, but the luxurious life has made me lazy.  
Person 2: And how about the tips?  
Person 1: I've got a dollar forty.  
Person 2: I need that—I gave my last dollar to the steward.  
Person 1: No way.  
Person 2: Come on, I'll organize a card game and we'll win more.  
Person 1: Until then, the dollar forty stays with me.  
Person 2: Is that how you treat a friend?  
Person 1: Don't let money ruin our friendship. Look at all these telegrams to deliver! It's not work, it's like a marathon.",347
"Person 1: Ray, have you lost your mind?  
Person 2: You heard Kelly say ""Sam."" That was Lombardo on the line. And you saw those girls...  
Person 1: Ray, that conversation on the recording is completely unintelligible. And what do we have here? You on the Van Ryans' property, without a warrant, filming a porno...  
Person 2: I can't believe you're saying this. A month ago, you were the one separating those two in court. They were just pretending. They all were, from the very beginning. And we fell for it like children... And now they're free with six million dollars from Sandra Van Ryan.",348
"Person 1: Don't be afraid, it's just me. Your friend couldn't deliver this folder after the surgery, so it's my task now.  
Person 2: Who are you?  
Person 1: Let me talk to that woman.  
Person 2: There's no woman here.  
Person 1: If you've already dealt with her, so be it. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We have nothing to talk about.  
Person 2: Wait.  
Person 1: If her child or husband are in danger, then we also have nothing to talk about.  
Person 2: Let her tell you that.",349

Person 2: You know, love can be complicated. Sometimes I don't even know if I really want to love you. Maybe you could show me that it's really worth it?",350
"Person 1: When are the visits?  
Person 2: I have an appointment with Dr. Gynde at 10:30. Jeffrey, you'll have to walk because I need the car in the morning.  
Person 1: Okay.  
Person 2: Jeffrey, when you see your father...  
Person 1: Yes?  
Person 2: He doesn't know you dropped out of school. He thinks you're on vacation.  
Person 1: What?  
Person 2: It would be too difficult for him. So please, let him think you're just home to visit him.  
Person 1: Thanks, Mom.  
Person 2: Jeffrey! No one wanted you to drop out of school and work in the store. Maybe one day going back to school will be possible. I hope so.",351
"Person 1: ...But surely you don't know him better than this council, do you, Miss Archuh?
Person 2: Well, maybe I --
Person 1: Only someone unreasonable thinks they know everything about something they have no idea about. How did it go?
Person 2: That's something completely different --
Person 1: You don't even know yourself... you're not that genuine, are you, Miss Archuh?
Person 2: Sometimes, because of my work, I have to be discreet --
Person 1: That's not the point! Why do you pretend to be so bitter? That will never make you happy! It was the same with Warin.
Person 2: I am happy enough.
Person 1: Okay, Miss Archuh. ...I have my own matters to attend to.
Person 2: I am really happy!",352

"Person 1: Listen, I know you might be close with Foley.  
Person 2: We're not. I'm just helping him, that's all...  
Person 1: Wait, Glenn. You helped him? As of now, technically speaking, it's hard to accuse you of aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice. You can keep helping him and risk ending up in handcuffs, praying you get a lenient judge instead of a strict one. Or, if you want to play it differently...",354
"Person 1: The family hired you, but I'm the one dismissing you now, Mr. Lombard.

Person 2: Why, Mrs. De Moraes? Why would someone as influential as you hire someone like me, a small French detective, to find your missing son?

Person 1: What are you imagining, Mr. Lombard?

Person 2: Wouldn't it be better if Nazi hunters took care of this?",355
"Person 1: I really sacrificed a lot for you so that you could have a comfortable life and be happy. After everything I've done...

Person 2: I know, Daniel, I appreciate what you've done, but love isn't a transaction.

Person 2: I do see them, but a relationship is something we both need to work on.",356
"Person 1: You have always been so good to us, to Li Mu Bai and me. We are very grateful to you.  
Person 2: Don't be so formal. Stay the night as my guest. And now, Shu Lien... I would like to ask you something. Your father was like a brother to me, and I treat you like a daughter.  
Person 1: What is it about?  
Person 2: Li Mu Bai is giving up the sword and the life of a warrior... could he be trying to tell you something by this?  
Person 1: I'm not sure...  
Person 2: Don't pretend. I've always known about your feelings. So many years have passed, and neither of you has had the courage to admit the truth. It's a shame to waste time.  
Person 1: I'm sorry, but Li Mu Bai and I are not cowards.  
Person 2: When it comes to feelings, even the greatest heroes can get lost. Tell me, will Li Mu Bai be more open when you see him next time? If not, I will talk to him!",357
"Person 1: What's going on? I really would like to know. My wife comes to me and asks for twenty-five thousand. What's this about? Do you need a coat?  
Person 2: No.  
Person 1: If you want a coat, you'll get it. It's not a matter of money, but I would like to know what it's needed for. Don't I have the right to know?  
Person 2: Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I've never had to ask anyone for anything. And now you're forcing me to beg.  
Person 1: What are you talking about?  
Person 2: Really? You're making me feel humiliated. Why do you want me to feel so bad?  
Person 1: I'm asking you for twenty-five thousand. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want to be sure that I can trust you. You know, it's a matter of trust. I need to trust you like I trust myself. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?  
Person 2: You can trust me.

Person 2: I know, but...  
Person 1: You had an affair with her, Robert! We went to therapy for a whole year!  
Person 2: Now I only meet with her for professional reasons.  
Person 1: You told me you don't see her at all.

"Person 1: I feel like this is our moment! This could be our big breakthrough, Ray. We'll do something that will get us on the front pages of the newspapers.
Person 2: Calm down, are you crazy? If this comes to light, we'll be in trouble. The judge clearly said: no such actions.
Person 1: Don't worry, we'll do it quietly and discreetly. No one will notice.",360

Person 1: Absolutely not! Say you have executive privilege and block it to the end. Invoke the Fifth Amendment. I don't care. They can't force the president's people to testify.
Person 2: But that will make us look like we're hiding something.
Person 1: Because we are hiding something! It's about some trivial, stupid matters. There are things I can say – if others said them, they would be lies. But when I say it, no one believes me anyway...",364
"Person 1: The priest wants me to leave here. He’s worried about me because of you.  
Person 2: Don’t believe him, Madeleine. He only worries about himself. He’s like a wolf, and you are a temptation for him.  
Person 1: He is a man of God, faithful to his vows.  
Person 2: Remember that above all, he is a man. You remind him of that, and that’s why he doesn’t like you.",365
"Person 1: Grace, you really need to come with me. This is important.
Person 2: No, you'll only hurt him.
Person 1: He's fine. Look, there's nothing wrong with him.
Person 2: I don't want to!
Person 1: Grace, please... you have to trust me, just this one time.",366
"Person 1: They behave like wild animals.  
Person 2: Maybe they're frustrated because they grew up in institutions, not in family homes.  
Person 1: What homes? We all grow up the same way, but most of us don't end up as savages.  
Person 2: Some say that children need maternal care.  
Person 1: That's nonsense. Daycare centers provide better care than any mother.  
Person 2: I'm just repeating what people say... Have you ever wondered who your mother was?  
Person 1: No, I've never thought about it.  
Person 2: I sometimes wonder.  
Person 1: When did you start questioning our principles?  
Person 2: I don't remember exactly... maybe when I was younger. And what would you like to experience again, Logan?  
Person 1: Interesting question — how many years has it been?",367
"Person 1: Legacie Meridas, it is an honor to have you here in our arena! Show everyone what you can do!
Person 2: I am not a gladiator. I will not fight.
Person 1: In that case, death awaits you... Think carefully about your decision.",368
"Person 1: I was wondering if you preferred to write it by hand, or maybe you just didn't feel like it?
Person 2: You know, I'm not the best at handwriting. Besides, I don't feel confident in organizing events either.
Person 1: Well, yes, sometimes it can seem like you don't have everything under control, right?",369
"Person 1: I know this might sound like a cliché, but love is more than just a feeling. It's a passion, something without which it's hard to imagine life. If you don't start with that, what will come of it? I'm telling you, fall head over heels in love. Find someone whom you will love madly and who will reciprocate that feeling. How to find them? Stop analyzing and listen to your heart. Even if you get burned, you'll come out stronger. Because the truth is, life without love is meaningless. If you go through life without experiencing true love, it's as if you haven't lived at all. You have to try. Because if you don't try, you won't experience the fullness of life.
Person 2: Well, beautifully said.
Person 1: Oh, you're tough.
Person 2: Sorry, but can you summarize that for me?
Person 1: Be open. Who knows? Maybe Cupid's arrow will suddenly strike you.",370
"Person 1: Why did you talk to the manager about my project behind my back?
Person 2: I thought there were some issues that needed to be resolved. You know I always try to make everything as good as possible.
Person 1: You should have come to me first. Now I look bad in front of the team.
Person 2: I really just wanted to help. I thought talking to the manager would help find a solution faster. I care about the success of the whole team.
Person 1: In the future, please talk to me directly. Together we can solve these problems.",371
"Person 1: Jamie, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to turn out this way. I can go with Brady tomorrow evening, it's really no problem.  
Person 2: But you planned to go today. It's because of me that it didn't work out.  
Person 1: You know what, I have an idea for something even better today. What do you say to trick-or-treating?  
Person 2: I'm not in the mood.  
Person 1: But it's Halloween! Don't you really want to dress up in a scary costume and get loads of candy? It will be so much fun, we can't miss it!",372
"Person 1: Toddy, have one more glass, it's really worth it.  
Person 2: No, thanks, I've already had quite a bit to drink today.  
Person 1: Come on, one small glass won't hurt you.",373
"Person 1: Come on, Rose, just for a moment. What's the harm?
Person 2: You don't even realize how wrong this is.
Person 1: Come on, Rose, I just want to see what it looks like.
Person 2: You don't need to know that. It's none of your business.
Person 1: Oh, be a friend, Rose. You like me, don't you? I really like you.",374
"Person 1: Harry, why aren't you looking at me?
Person 2: And why should I be looking at you all the time?
Person 1: Because I want you to.
Person 2: What, are you going to threaten me now? Do I have to do something by tomorrow, or else you'll do something to me?
Person 1: Come on, Harry. At worst, you'll end up with a conviction for writing a bad check. I don't think you want something like that to happen, especially in your situation.
Person 2: Ugh, it's like a basketball game...",375
"Person 1: Nathan, it's because of hormones. I really have no control over it. I'm sorry.  
Person 2: Are you saying it affects your whole body?  
Person 1: Yes, I'm doing electrolysis, but it takes time. In the meantime, I have to manage somehow...  
Person 2: You have to shave? Like some kind of savage?  
Person 1: Savages don't shave, stop being mean!  
Person 2: Don't nitpick about such things. You know what I mean.  
Person 1: I'm sorry. Please, don't be mad at me because of this.  
Person 2: Mad? I'm... shocked!  
Person 1: I'm still the same person I was before you found out about this!  
Person 2: I need to think about it! I really need to think about it!",376
"Person 1: I'm really struggling with the pressure at work. It's affecting my health.  
Person 2: Do you remember how I turned down that job offer in New York for you?  
Person 1: Yes, I remember, and I'm grateful to you for that.  
Person 2: Maybe you should try to stick it out a little longer. After all, it was a big decision on my part. Maybe now you could sacrifice a bit?  
Person 1: That's not fair, Kevin. Our situations were completely different.  
Person 2: Life is rarely fair, Elaine. Sometimes we have to sacrifice something.",377
"Person 1: I can't believe they pay you for being the same difficult person you've always been.  
Person 2: Amazing, right? You, the old troublemaker from Bensonhurst, still in dreamland. Look at us, two rock 'n' roll detectives. Though only one of us truly is.  
Person 1: It was nice getting all those calls from you once you were successful, you sly guy from Red Hook.  
Person 2: I don't recall Detective Rock 'n' Roll sending me holiday cards.  
Person 1: Friendship looks different here. It only takes one wrong move to become part of a relationship. But that's not what this conversation is about.",378
"Person 1: Come on, remember how five years ago your kidneys stopped working? If you were unlucky, would you really have found a donor with a perfect match? What are the odds, one in a million?
Person 2: So am I supposed to be happy that my brother died in the explosion?
Person 1: That's not what I meant. I mean, you were lucky that those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never cared about you.",379
"Person 1: No... I didn't... Oh God, Billy, there was someone who tried to kill me.
Person 2: The police say I scared him off. It couldn't have been me, Sid.
Person 1: I know. He called again yesterday, this time to Tatum's house.
Person 2: See? It couldn't have been me, I was in jail then, remember?
Person 1: I'm sorry... Please, understand me.
Person 2: Understand what? That I have a girlfriend who'd rather accuse me of being a psychopath than touch me?
Person 1: You know that's not true.
Person 2: So what's going on? Do you have your eye on someone else?
Person 1: No...
Person 2: Is it about sex? Am I too pushy?
Person 1: No, Billy, it's me. I need time. I'm still trying to come to terms with my mom's death.
Person 2: It's been a year.
Person 1: Tomorrow. Tomorrow it will be a year.
Person 2: When will you finally put it behind you, Sid? When my mom left my dad, I had to accept it. That's life. She's not coming back.
Person 1: Your parents split up. It's not the same. Your mom left, she's not lying in a coffin.
Person 2: You need to move on, Sid.",380
"Person 1: Seriously, she really exists?  
Person 2: Oh yes, I've read about her many times. She's a real treasure. The perfect daddy's girl, exemplary and innocent.  
Person 1: So what? Do you want to fly to Kansas and get that little Dorothy?  
Person 2: Actually, I don't have to. Her father got a job as the new director in Oakwood, and she's now staying with my aunt in Connecticut while her father sells their house. Imagine how that will boost my reputation. Seducing the virtuous daughter of the new director even before school starts? That will be my greatest success.  
Person 1: You don't stand a chance. She's out of your league.  
Person 2: Want to bet on it?  
Person 1: I'll think about it...  
Person 2: Well, duty calls. Time to write another chapter of my masterpiece.",381
"Person 1: I'm sorry, Randy, but I can't let her in. After the way she behaved, I just can't allow it.
Person 2: You're really not letting me in?
Person 1: How do I know what you'll do in there? I don't want to take the risk...
Person 2: What could I possibly do? I've been in the same clothes for two days! I just want to grab a few of my things. Is that really such a problem?",382
"Person 1: Why not?  
Person 2: Come on, Kasia. It's too trivial. ""I thought high school only lasted four years."" Really? She knows nothing. She wouldn't even realize if I outsmarted her before they bring the appetizer at Au Bar. Go, ask one of your buddies to handle it. I have to maintain my reputation.  
Person 1: And hitting on the therapist's daughter is a challenge?  
Person 2: That was just revenge. What I'm planning now requires real genius.",383
"Person 1: Do you want coffee or something else?  
Person 2: Maybe they have some espresso in the kitchen...  
Person 1: You know, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors and know each other well complicates things a bit, don't you think?  
Person 2: My husband probably fell asleep in the bathroom again, or at least he would like to be there. We've been married for 17 years, and I'm not going to worry about it now... So I think that since your wife left with someone else, and you're here alone, maybe we should do something that makes sense. Just spend time together, keep each other warm. Nothing more.",384
"Person 1: Ania, I need to tell you something. I was standing there, looking at that horse, and I felt like the same thing was happening to me.  
Person 2: I don't quite understand...  
Person 1: I have two options. I can either fight what is or accept it. I've always known that I love you more. It didn't bother me. I felt lucky that such a wonderful woman wanted to be with me. I thought that if I were the best husband and father, it wouldn't matter if we loved each other the same way. I didn't ask for more. But you don't even know how you feel about me. You're not sure if you want to be with me. And I don't want you to come back until you know that for sure.",385
"Person 1: Maybe we should do those blood tests tomorrow? What do you think?
Person 2: Tomorrow?
Person 1: Or even this afternoon. It's a perfect day for such things.
Person 2: Benjamin, I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Person 1: But we need birth certificates, right? I already have mine with me. And you, where's yours?",386
"Person 1: I want you to build a bridge over the Tsavo River and finish it within four months. Is that possible?
Person 2: You must be familiar with my previous projects. You know I always meet deadlines.
Person 1: But you have never worked in Africa before.
Person 2: I have worked in India. Every place has its challenges.
Person 1: You will need that confidence. I can guarantee you that.
Person 2: I have a reason more important than confidence. My wife is expecting our first child in five months, and I promised her I would be there when the time comes.
Person 1: That's very touching, Patterson. I appreciate you telling me that. But you must understand that your personal life is not my priority. You accepted this task, so don't force me to make difficult decisions.
Person 2: You won't have to. Do you have any more advice? Because I need to catch a train.",387
"Person 1: Do you remember when you promised to help me with the project, and then you backed out?  
Person 2: Yes, I remember. But maybe it's better to focus on the present instead of going back to the past.  
Person 1: It's hard to forget, considering I had to pull an all-nighter because of it.  
Person 2: It seems to me that you're holding on too tightly to what happened. Maybe it's better if we just move on?  
Person 1: It's about responsibility and trust.  
Person 2: I understand, but don't you think it's worth letting go sometimes and not holding a grudge? We can move forward.",388
"Person 1: I think we should stay here for the night. You'll come back home with me. We can rent the house and the land; the neighbors will surely be interested. It's really the only sensible decision.
Person 2: I don't want to leave.
Person 1: I understand, but sometimes life forces us to make difficult decisions. You didn't want your father to leave, but it happened. Sometimes we have no choice.",389
"Person 1: Willie, don't listen to them! Progress is something worth celebrating without unnecessary limitations. Don't let them convince you that you need to take small steps before you can start running. Or that you need to run before you can dance the waltz! Life is too short to waste time on such considerations!

Person 2: Give me that child before you start filling their head with nonsense!",390
"Person 1: What, should I just eliminate her? Or maybe everyone? Including myself? Or even the president?
Person 2: Calm down, don't panic. Unless you want Farrah to end up in a room full of criminals.",391
"Person 1: Our offer is really simple. Your brother will only pay if you are completely satisfied. It's a satisfaction guarantee.
Person 2: So if I don't like it, he doesn't have to pay?
Person 1: In practice, we've never had such a situation. All our clients are always satisfied.
Person 2: So, what happens if someone is dissatisfied?
Person 1: You know, we've never had a dissatisfied client. You're demanding, but that's good – we're confident you'll be satisfied.",392
"Person 1: Come on, tell me what happened. I love knowing all the details.
Person 2: No.
Person 1: What? Why not?
Person 2: It's private.
Person 1: You must be joking. You better tell me, or I'll make such a scene that you won't know what's happening.
Person 2: Let's leave it at that.",393
"Person 1: Why did you choose this building to break into?  
Person 2: It was the biggest in the area. Come on, who wouldn't be tempted?  
Person 1: But really, why did you do it?  
Person 2: It was about the feeling of freedom. Who doesn't dream of such an escape from reality?  
Person 1: Either you're spinning a tale, or you really don't know what you're doing.",394
"Person 1: Who is that?
Person 2: It's just a neighbor. We talked for a moment.
Person 1: A neighbor, huh? Don't make me laugh. Or maybe you like it when someone calls you? Maybe you'd like to meet up with him?",395
"Person 1: I hope you're pleased with yourself!  
Person 2: It's not my fault, it was about the alcohol, you know.  
Person 1: It is your fault.  
Person 2: No, she went there on her own. It's not my responsibility.  
Person 1: Listen, it happened at your place, so it's your problem. Hello, yes, we need help at Circle A on First Street. Yes, thank you. Now you're in trouble, buddy! Please send an ambulance because I suspect an overdose. Okay. Jeff, they're already on their way. Stay here. I'm going to Scuff to see if he has his truck. If anything happens to her, you'll regret ever coming to this town!",396
"Person 1: I can't believe you're making this up – it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Person 2: Clyde Fitch, although you might not think so, was writing long before my time!
Person 1: I've always denied the rumors that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Person 2: That's not funny!
Person 1: Of course it's funny – it's all too absurd to take seriously. You know what I think about your obsession with age – and now this ridiculous bout of jealousy because I spent ten minutes with some young theater enthusiast...
Person 2: Twenty minutes!
Person 1: Thirty, forty minutes! So what?
Person 2: ""Theater enthusiast""... she's a young lady with class. And for your information, I've had enough of both her and her class! She watches me like I'm some kind of exhibit! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
Person 1: How can you be offended by someone trying to be like your ideal!
Person 2: Stop calling her a girl! There are certain aspects of my life I'd like to have exclusive rights to!
Person 1: Like what?
Person 2: For example – you!
Person 1: That's my cue to hug you and calm you down – but I won't. I'm too angry...
Person 2: ...guilty.
Person 1: Angry! Darling, there are certain traits you're known for – on stage and off. I love you for some of them – and despite others. I haven't let them become too important to me. It's part of your way of surviving in our environment – you have to have sharp teeth. Fine. But you won't sharpen them on me – or on Eve...
Person 2: What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Person 1: She doesn't have them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic, dreamy girl by the cynical standards of this megalomaniac society – I won't allow it! Eve Harrington has never indicated anything to me other than admiration for you and joy in our relationship! And suggesting otherwise isn't jealousy – it's paranoid insecurity, of which you should be ashamed!
Person 2: Cut! Print! What happens in the next scene? Am I dragged off screaming to the madhouse?",397
"Person 1: I was worried sick about you!
Person 2: But Sean said...
Person 1: You should listen to me, not Sean! Do you really think dropping anchor in the middle of a storm is a good idea?",398
"Person 1: Come on, Dad, what will you get out of this? What will happen if you give it all up? Will you get sick or something? Once, I pulled a trick and avoided the army.  
Person 2: It's not a trick, I'm telling you the truth. I'm talking about the words of the prophet Elijah, about a God who is black. Believe me, son, God is black.  
Person 1: What? Everyone knows God is white.  
Person 2: Everything the white man taught you, you accepted without question. He told you that you were a savage, and you believed him. He said he brought you from darkness into light, and you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond-haired, blue-eyed God with white skin—and you believed him. He told you that black is a curse, and you believed him. Have you ever checked what ""black"" really means?  
Person 1: Why would I do that?  
Person 2: Have you ever thought about something that wasn't part of some manipulation?  
Person 1: And what will that give me?  
Person 2: Go, before it's too late. The people who are lying to you are just waiting for that.  
Person 1: Alright, alright. Show me what you mean.  ",399
"Person 1: How could you! This is inhumane! That monster... He terrifies me, and you let me down! You knew where to strike, didn't you? At the funeral, you had your arm in a sling! I didn't have to sleep with you to figure that out.  
Person 2: He repeated exactly what you said.  
Person 1: You knew. You knew the whole time that he was there, that he was following me, and yet you lied. You used me, used me as bait. Were you with me just to kill time, waiting for him to attack?",400
"Person 1: Is this a good idea?  
Person 2: What do you mean?  
Person 1: Others might notice it.  
Person 2: So what?  
Person 1: This is something that should stay between us.  
Person 2: I know, but really, so what?  
Person 1: Others might see it too, don't you understand?  
Person 2: I don't care about it that much.  
Person 1: And it's really important to me!",401
"Person 1: I managed to negotiate better terms with our suppliers. That's great news for the company!  
Person 2: You did this without consulting me first? I'm the one who handles this area, Neil.  
Person 1: I saw an opportunity and decided to take it.  
Person 2: Bypassing me in such matters is not the best idea. We have established procedures for a reason.  
Person 1: I understand, I'll try to keep that in mind next time. I just wanted to act for the good of the company, and that's the most important thing, right?",402
"Person 1: I would like to fly, sir!  
Person 2: That's not an argument. Everyone would like to fly. Even my grandmother dreams about it. And you, what, want to be a jet pilot?  
Person 1: Yes, I would like to fly jets, sir!  
Person 2: And why? Do you want to be alone at high altitudes?  
Person 1: No, sir!  
Person 2: So what, are you looking for adrenaline? Is that what you want?  
Person 1: I want to do something exceptional, something not everyone can do.  
Person 2: I don't think you have the character for it.  
Person 1: That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I can do it, sir!  
Person 2: You don't stand a chance, boy!",403
"Person 1: Do you really listen to all those recordings?  
Person 2: No, but I see how the tape recorder affects you. How are you feeling today?  
Person 1: A bit worse than yesterday.  
Person 2: So, as usual. What do you think about the simulation you participated in yesterday?  
Person 1: John died.  
Person 2: I know. I was there and saw everything. If I were your therapist, I'd tell you to avoid such situations.  
Person 1: You're not my therapist. You're here to study me. To you, I'm just an experimental subject.  
Person 2: That's not true.  
Person 1: If I had died yesterday, you'd probably already be analyzing my brain, looking for some genetic predispositions to violence.  
Person 2: What did you feel when you killed the waiter?  
Person 1: Not much. It was just a simulation. Nothing more.  
Person 2: You didn't see your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did. You liked it, didn't you? That thrill of crossing boundaries... Eliminating random people just to achieve your goal...  
Person 1: Leave me alone.  
Person 2: It was exactly like before, wasn't it? But I see progress. Instead of killing seven people to catch one, this time there was only one additional victim.  
Person 1: Enough!",404
"Person 1: I want to go in alone. It's important to me.
Person 2: Listen, without my help you won't get the code to the Mask. You really don't have another choice.",405
"Person 1: I still wonder why they want disarmament.
Person 2: Maybe for the same reasons we do. Isn't it obvious?
Person 1: No, it's not. They don't respect human life. They wouldn't mind losing an entire country just to win.
Person 2: Well, that last statement seems a bit illogical.
Person 1: You sound like you're thinking like them!
Person 2: Absolutely not. That's really not what I meant.
Person 1: Don't be offended. Our president thinks similarly to me.
Person 2: Don't you think the president has more knowledge on this subject?
Person 1: I'll tell you what I think. If someone says they are for disarmament, they are either a traitor or a fool.
Person 2: But we're being cautious. We haven't agreed to anything for years. Many people say we will never agree.
Person 1: But if they suddenly opened up and allowed inspections, we would agree, right?
Person 2: If they gave us what we need, then yes, I think we would agree.
Person 1: And would you want that to happen?
Person 2: If the president and experts are satisfied with it, then so am I.
Person 1: Do you think we would cheat?
Person 2: No, I'm sure we wouldn't.
Person 1: And do you think they would cheat?
Person 2: I'm not an expert, but I've heard of ideas like a reward for revealing cheating. It's hard to hide such things. If someone had something to hide, they wouldn't want to risk someone spilling the beans for a million dollars. We're just as clever as they are, and if they cheat, we would immediately withdraw.
Person 1: I have to say this, but it seems to me that someone has indoctrinated you, and you don't even know it.",406
"Person 1: Hi! If you show me where everything is, I'll make us some delicious coffee.
Person 2: No, let's not go back home. It's so beautiful outside, it's a shame to sit indoors.
Person 1: My sister will come over for brunch right after me. Come with us, it'll be great!
Person 2: You know, I still have to work a bit at the factory.
Person 1: I'll just grab my purse.
Person 2: I'll bring it. Stay here, you look great in this sunlight...",407
"Person 1: Look at those beautiful trees... strong trunks, lots of branches. It's the perfect place for logging, don't you think?
Person 2: Logging? But we'll have to conduct environmental impact studies...
Person 1: Oh, Janet, don't be so formal. We'll arrange all the necessary documents and it'll be done.",408
"Person 1: Why did you make the decision without consulting me?
Person 2: I just wanted to do what's best for both of us.
Person 1: Your decisions affect both of us. You should have consulted me.
Person 2: I know, I meant well. I promise I'll try harder next time.
Person 1: That's what I expect.",409
"Person 1: Hey, what do you say about coming over to our place this weekend? You'll get to see the kids. They're growing up so fast, and it would be a shame for you to miss it.  
Person 2: You know, Frank, I'm not really fond of your kids.  
Person 1: But you're their uncle.  
Person 2: Only in name. Besides, they don't really like me either.  
Person 1: Not at all! They keep asking about you.  
Person 2: Frank, they tried to electrocute me.  
Person 1: That was just an accident.  
Person 2: An accident? Frank, Cindy threw a radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?  
Person 1: She had no idea what she was doing. Honestly, you're overreacting.  
Person 2: Your kids are a bit... unusual, Frank.  
Person 1: Look, I just think that if you come over, you'll see for yourself what you're missing out on.",410
"Person 1: You lied to me!  
Person 2: What are you talking about?  
Person 1: I spoke with Joanne Braslow. She said she saw you taking cocaine at Marsha's.  
Person 2: She must be mistaken.  
Person 1: That's not a sufficient explanation!  
Person 2: It's not true. Please, believe me.  
Person 1: I don't have to believe you. The court needs to be convinced, and ""she's mistaken"" is not enough.  
Person 2: I don't take cocaine anymore. If she claims she saw me, she's lying.  
Person 1: Why would she lie?  
Person 2: I don't know, Frank. Maybe we should find out? Maybe someone put her up to it to ruin me?",411
"Person 1: I'm going out for lunch.  
Person 2: Lunch? I'm ordering coffee and sandwiches to the office. We can't leave until everything is ready for the opening.  
Person 1: But my friends are waiting for me.  
Person 2: Unfortunately, they'll have to wait. Are your friends more important than your job?  
Person 1: I just want to go out for half an hour.  
Person 2: If you leave before the work is finished, it might turn out that your absence will last longer... maybe even permanently.  
Person 1: Alright, I'll tell them. They're waiting for me in front of the building.",412
"Person 1: Mr. Rothstein, you will regret this, really.
Person 2: I'll regret it more if I leave you here.
Person 1: You don't treat people like this, it's unfair.
Person 2: Listen, if you didn't know they were cheating you, then you're not suited for this job. And if you did know, it means you were involved. Either way, you're out! Get out! Now!",413
"Person 1: What's going on?
Person 2: Are you having an affair?
Person 1: Where did that idea even come from? I ate lunch alone, and now suddenly I'm involved with someone?
Person 2: So, are you having an affair?
Person 1: No, I'm not. I'm really surprised by such an accusation.
Person 2: If it's true, I want to know. I'd prefer you to be honest. I'd be angry, but even more so if I found out you were lying to me.
Person 1: There's nothing to discover, Ania.
Person 2: You have no idea how upset I would be if you lied to me.
Person 1: Ania, you're overreacting. I just wanted to spend time with you, and you're treating me like I've done something wrong. You know, many women would be happy to have a young, handsome guy who earns well by their side.
Person 2: Like my sister, for example? Is it about her?
Person 1: For heaven's sake, Ania, I'm not having an affair with your sister. She's just not my type.
Person 2: Is that supposed to reassure me?
Person 1: I'm just saying. When you didn't want to spend time with me, I didn't think it was because you were having an affair.
Person 2: But I'm not.
Person 1: Neither am I!
Person 2: Why don't I believe you?
Person 1: This conversation is pointless. If you have any evidence, then we'll talk, but don't accuse me based on a hunch.
Person 2: Always the lawyer.
Person 1: Of course. Imagine: ""Your Honor, I know he's guilty. I have no evidence, but I have a hunch.""
Person 2: I understand what you're trying to say.
Person 1: I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of stress with this Kirkland project. It's my first big case as a junior partner, I'm working all day, I come home, I'm happy to see you, and such accusations hurt me.",414
"Person 1: Listen, you need to get out of here. You weren't here in the morning, remember what happened then?  
Person 2: But I didn't do anything!  
Person 1: The police won't believe you anyway. They'll want to investigate everything thoroughly.  
Person 2: But we have his note, that should explain the situation.  
Person 1: Do you want them to start asking you about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton, it will be better if I handle this myself.  
Person 2: But how will you explain that you pulled him out of the pool?  
Person 1: You're right. We need to put him back in there before anyone notices.",415
"Person 1: You know, a nutritious breakfast is the key to a successful day...

Person 2: Well, I forgot to mention that you're on a diet... Your appearance is the only thing you still somehow manage.

Person 1: Mom, that embarrasses me.

Person 2: Does every one of your statements since that ""incident"" have to be so monotonous and sarcastic?

Person 1: Maybe a little.

Person 2: You know, sometimes people give up their careers for family or vice versa. But you, Selina, seem to have discovered something new: ""doing nothing."" Maybe it's a new trend? How do you like that sarcasm?

Person 1: Pretty well... Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate being able to live with you and that you helped me with a job. I'm a mess, still trying to pull myself together. It's just... we need to start talking differently. I can't stand it...",416
"Person 1: Do you know what I'm thinking about?
Person 2: I think so.
Person 1: What about?
Person 2: You want to sleep with me. But it's not that simple.
Person 1: Why not?
Person 2: You know why.
Person 1: Because you're a virgin?
Person 2: Yes, and I don't want to risk getting pregnant.
Person 1: Do you think I want a child? You don't have to worry about that with me.
Person 2: Why do you think that?
Person 1: Because I really care about you. I think you're beautiful. I believe that if we were together, you would be truly happy.
Person 2: I'm not sure. I'm afraid it will change our relationship.
Person 1: What could change? I promise nothing will change. I just want you to be happy. That's the most important thing to me.",417
"Person 1: I couldn't stop her, though I really tried. We rarely have the chance to fix past mistakes. You are my chance, Judy.  
Person 2: Please, take me away from here...  
Person 1: You look just like Madeleine. Come on, go up the stairs.  
Person 2: No, I don't want to!  
Person 1: Judy, please, go up the stairs. I'll be right behind you.",418
"Person 1: What's going on with you? Have you gone crazy?  
Person 2: Maybe a little, but does it matter? Life only makes sense when you feel like you're truly living. Isn't that your motto, Elektra?  
Person 1: What are you even talking about?  
Person 2: Or did you pick up that slogan from your old friend, Renard?  
Person 1: ...what?  
Person 2: Yes, I met with him. He knew about us, he knew about my weakness, he knew exactly how to hurt me...",419
"Person 1: What's in there?
Person 2: Tomatoes.
Person 1: Ha! How do you know about the Stardust Ballroom?
Person 2: Tomek told me. He claims it's a great place.
Person 1: Ah, Tomek... Mom, it's just a big dance hall, nothing more. I've been there hundreds of times. It's full of people. You're funny, mom.
Person 2: Marty, I don't want you sitting at home tonight. I want you to shave and go dancing.
Person 1: Mom, when will you stop? I'm a bachelor and I'll never get married.
Person 2: You will get married.
Person 1: Sooner or later, you have to face the truth. Women want something I don't have. I've tried enough already. I've been to enough dances. I've suffered enough. I don't want to suffer anymore. I recently called a girl and got rejected. It hurt. I thought it wouldn't bother me anymore, but it did. I didn't even want to call her, and it still hurt. I don't want to go to the Stardust Ballroom because I always felt like I didn't belong there. I have feelings too. Enough of this pain. No, thank you.
Person 2: Marty...
Person 1: Mom, I'm staying home and watching Jackie Gleason.
Person 2: You'll die without a son.
Person 1: Then I'll die without a son.
Person 2: Wear the blue suit...
Person 1: Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still fat. Fat and ugly.
Person 2: You're not ugly.
Person 1: I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'M UGLY!
Person 2: Marty...
Person 1: Mom! Leave me alone!",420
"Person 1: Have you ever experienced closeness with a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face, her skin against yours, body next to body?
Person 2: My creator did not want me to experience that.
Person 1: Maybe now I can teach you that.",421
"Person 1: Why did you save me? We don't even know each other. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. It's just part of the game.
Person 2: You betrayed me!
Person 1: You killed Gin!
Person 2: I had to do it. You forced me into it.
Person 1: Nonsense, you killed him, not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie deceiving you.
Person 2: Stop it!",422
"Person 1: Judy, really? As soon as he got all the money, freedom, and power, he left you high and dry? That's really sad. He knew you couldn't do anything to defend yourself. And what did you get from him?

Person 2: He gave me some money.

Person 1: And that necklace, Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. You shouldn't have kept mementos from something like that. Sentimentalism doesn't always work out for the best.",423
"Person 1: Go ahead, come in, don't be shy.  
Person 2: You know, I'd like to talk about that other matter.  
Person 1: What, are you afraid of girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come on, I'll show you something that will really interest you. I promise you won't regret it, it will be something special.",424
"Person 1: Hello?  
Person 2: Hi, this is Laura, I'm a counselor. How can I help you?  
Person 1: Laura, I think I just killed someone.  
Person 2: Are you sure? Maybe it's just shock?  
Person 1: Yes, I'm sure. I killed someone! What have I done?!  
Person 2: In that case, you should call the police.  
Person 1: No, I need to talk to you. Only you can help me.  
Person 2: I'm sorry, but your voice...  
Person 1: Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? You're listening to me, right?  
Person 2: Who are you?  
Person 1: It's me, your mother, Sidney. Be good and turn on the news. Do it now!",425
"Person 1: You don't know how powerful the dark side is. I must obey my master.  
Person 2: I will never turn to the dark side. You'll have to kill me.  
Person 1: If that is your destiny...  
Person 2: Father, listen to your heart. I know that deep down you don't want to do this. I feel there is a conflict within you. Let go of your hate.  
Person 1: It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is now your master.",426
"Person 1: I can immediately tell that you're from here. Today's youth have no idea what it means to be well-mannered.  
Person 2: In our home, there was always an emphasis on good manners. We knew how to behave and how to address our elders. That's why we are better than others.",427
"Person 1: I know I was a really bad mother. I've thought it all through from your point of view and I realize how much I let you down.  
Person 2: Mhm.  
Person 1: I wonder if you ever looked at it from my side.  
Person 2: Never.  
Person 1: Probably not. I was terrible, wasn't I? I was too immature when you needed me. I should have grown up, but I couldn't. I know it hurt you.",428
"Person 1: I've been asking for weeks for us to spend some time together. Is it really that difficult?
Person 2: Lana, I have a lot of work and I'm barely keeping up.
Person 1: If you cared about me, you would find a moment, no matter what.
Person 2: I really do care, but I also have to fulfill my responsibilities. Maybe we can try to find a solution?",429
"Person 1: Many people have been asking when they will finally be able to see the body. Where have you displayed it?  
Person 2: We haven't displayed it yet because we haven't finished the embalming. Actually, the remains of Margo Channing are right here. She's sitting. It was her last wish to be buried in a sitting position.  
Person 1: Don't you think it would be more natural if she were lying down?  
Person 2: You have no idea about feelings, natural or otherwise.  
Person 1: In that case, putting feelings aside, the guests were wondering if the music could be a bit more cheerful?  
Person 2: If my guests don't like it here, maybe they should go with you to the nursery; they'll surely feel at home there.",430
"Person 1: You know, they say the only way to change the system is to work from the inside.  
Person 2: Really? How about we first take this bracelet off my ankle. And those supposed poison needles?  
Person 1: Come on, X. Did you really think we were that primitive?  
Person 2: No needles, huh? And what about wanting to dip me in acid?  
Person 1: That was just for show. A psychological trick to get you to do what’s necessary.  
Person 2: You're a jerk, you know that?",431
"Person 1: Listen, does anyone else know about what we're planning?
Person 2: No.
Person 1: Great! I'm telling you, by the time they realize, we'll already be in Canada.
Person 2: Ca-na-da...
Person 1: You like the idea, right?
Person 2: Yes...
Person 1: Exactly. Imagine the whole world watching the Great Chief Bromden walking down the streets. I'm telling you, people will admire you...
Person 2: Ca-na-da...
Person 1: Shhh, Chief, don't say anything. It's our secret, okay?",432
"Person 1: Do you think she is as good as they say? After all, no one wants to buy a pig in a poke, right?

Person 2: Will, if you don't stop, I will really leave.

Person 1: I didn't mean to offend you. I just need to know.",433
"Person 1: But why? After all, she is my best friend.  
Person 2: She is not a true friend to anyone. I don't want you to live with her because she has a bad influence on you.  
Person 1: That's nonsense! She is one of the nicest people I know.  
Person 2: Really? What's so nice about her? In my opinion, she's a calculating materialist.  
Person 1: Don't talk about her like that!  
Person 2: I'll say what I think.  
Person 1: She sometimes jokes like that, but...  
Person 2: Don't fool yourself — she's not joking.  
Person 1: Do we really have to argue about this again?  
Person 2: I'm not arguing, I'm just...  ",434
"Person 1: I just came to say goodnight. I don't look my best, so I don't want you to look at me.
Person 2: Goodnight.
Person 1: You know, I've lost half a kilo since Tuesday.
Person 2: That's good.
Person 1: I was worried about my neck. That beautician worked wonders.
Person 2: I see.
Person 1: You should go to sleep too.
Person 2: I think I'll read a little longer.
Person 1: You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
Person 2: Why do you think that?
Person 1: I just know. I had a nightmare and called for you. You weren't there then. Where were you?
Person 2: I went for a walk.
Person 1: That's not true, you took the car.
Person 2: Okay, I went to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel like a prisoner in this house, do you?
Person 1: Of course not, Joe. I just don't want to be alone. Not now, when I'm under such stress. I'm just asking you for a little patience and support.
Person 2: I didn't do anything wrong, Norma.
Person 1: I know you didn't. I wouldn't let you.",435
"Person 1: Hi, Leon.
Person 2: Hi, Sonny.
Person 1: How are you holding up?
Person 2: I just got out of the hospital.
Person 1: Really? I thought that would never happen.
Person 2: I didn't think it would end like this. But oh well...
Person 1: How do you feel?
Person 2: I'm really shaken.
Person 1: I heard from Moretti that you were on medication.
Person 2: Yeah, it was awful. You go in there, and they immediately say you're crazy, and then they stuff you with meds. How are they supposed to help when you're constantly asleep?
Person 1: That's terrible...
Person 2: You can't talk to anyone, can't do anything. I'm just now starting to recover.
Person 1: That must be tough.
Person 2: Yes. And how about you?
Person 1: I'm fine, but I'm in trouble. I know that now.
Person 2: Yeah, I know.
Person 1: I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm dying.
Person 2: What? What are you talking about? Do you hear what you're saying?
Person 1: What do you mean?
Person 2: You tell me this every day. ""I'm dying."" Do you understand how that sounds?
Person 1: Don't start with that now.
Person 2: You really don't realize what it means. The things you do, Sonny. You put a gun to someone's head...
Person 1: I don't know what I'm doing.
Person 2: Of course, you don't know... you say to sleep so it won't hurt when you pull the trigger. Don't talk to me about death. I've been living with it for months. That's why I was in the hospital. Now I'm here, talking to you, and it's all repeating. I have no friends, no job. I have to live with people. I'm sorry!
Person 1: I'm not calling to talk about that. I don't know what to say, Leon. When you hit me with this... what am I supposed to say?
Person 2: I'm sorry...
Person 1: I told you I have a lot of pressure. I knew you needed money. I saw you in the hospital and thought I had to do something.
Person 2: But I didn't ask you to rob a bank.
Person 1: I know you didn't ask. I did it myself. I don't blame you. But now I have to settle things with life. Maybe it will all end. Maybe I'll close my eyes and it will be over. I wanted to bring you here, say goodbye... or, if you want, go on a journey...
Person 2: What journey?
Person 1: I'm leaving here. I'm not going to stay and give up. If I can get out of this, I'll get on a plane and fly away. That's all, Leon. If you want to fly with me, you can.
Person 2: Do you think I'd want to fly with you? Where to?
Person 1: I have a plane, and we'll try to get out of here. Let's fly!
Person 2: You're crazy.
Person 1: I know!
Person 2: Where are you flying to?
Person 1: Who knows? We talked about Algeria. So I'll fly there.
Person 2: Why Algeria?
Person 1: I don't know. Maybe they have something interesting there. I don't know myself.
Person 2: You're twisted. You really are.
Person 1: I know, I'm twisted!
Person 2: Algeria! You know people wear masks there? They're all crazy there.
Person 1: What should I do?
Person 2: I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Person 1: Denmark? Sweden?
Person 2: That sounds better!
Person 1: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming. I told him that's not a country. We need to get out of here! Can you imagine the state I'm in?",436
"Person 1: Jeanne, can you tell us why you jumped from the tower in Beaurevoir?  
Person 2: I was sold to the English. I preferred to die than to fall into their hands.  
Person 1: Was it the voices that told you to jump?  
Person 2: No...  
Person 1: So you wanted to kill yourself by jumping?  
Person 2: No...!  
Person 1: How can you deny it when you yourself said you would rather die than fall into the hands of the English?  
Person 2: That's not what I meant...  
Person 1: You know that suicide is a grave sin? No one has the right to take a life that God created.  
Person 2: I know, but it wasn't like that...  
Person 1: Are you saying that you didn't end up on the edge of your own will?  
Person 2: Yes, but...  
Person 1: And that the jump wasn't your decision?  
Person 2: No!  
Person 1: Really? Or maybe someone pushed you then?",437
"Person 1: Quiet, Brad is probably already asleep. Do you really want him to see you in this state? What will he think of you?
Person 2: In what state? It's all because of you. I was being careful.
Person 1: Well, you definitely have some strength left. Don't pretend you can't handle it.",438
"Person 1: Please don't worry about it, Major. I have a direct line to Air Force Command.
Person 2: I understand, General.
Person 1: We can't risk saboteurs pretending to be someone from the President or Command, right?
Person 2: I agree, General.
Person 1: That's why no calls can go out or come in without my approval.
Person 2: Of course, General. Nothing will go out or come in without your permission.
Person 1: Actually, no calls at all. Even my voice can be faked.
Person 2: Yes, General. But how can I be sure it's really you?
Person 1: Who else would you be talking to?
Person 2: I assume it's you, General. But how can I be certain?
Person 1: Does that mean you're questioning my orders?
Person 2: Absolutely not, General.
Person 1: I hope not. Now carry out my orders and pass Plan-R to the Wing.
Person 2: Plan-R? Did I hear that correctly?
Person 1: Are you having hearing problems, Major?
Person 2: No, General. Plan-R will be passed to the Wing.
Person 1: After that, shut down the communication center and assign security to the base.
Person 2: General Ripper, if I shut down the center, we'll lose contact with Air Force Command and others.
Person 1: Does that mean you're questioning my orders?
Person 2: No, General. I'm just informing you of the consequences.
Person 1: You're a good officer, Major. Thank you for pointing that out.
Person 2: Thank you, General.
Person 1: After completing the task, reinforce the base's security. Our enemies are cunning and may attempt an attack.
Person 2: Yes, General.
Person 1: Finally, confiscate all private radios. They could be used to communicate with saboteurs. The Air Police have lists of the owners.
Person 2: Understood, General.",439
"Person 1: You gave that cleaning lady 1500 zł! What’s going on with you?  
Person 2: She really needed it.  
Person 1: A 2000 zł tip? For her?  
Person 2: Her name is Inez. Stop calling her just a cleaning lady.  
Person 1: But that's what she is!  
Person 2: I know, but...  
Person 1: You're in love with her, aren't you?  
Person 2: Stop it!  
Person 1: Do you want to marry her? Have children with her who will clean? And spend your whole life scrubbing floors?",440
"Person 1: Johnson, is there something you don't like about the military?
Person 2: No, sir...
Person 1: Then how do you explain that out of one hundred and twenty people, only you tested positive for drugs?
Person 2: I'm sorry, sir.
Person 1: You were given a chance to join the army, and we kept our part of the deal.
Person 2: Yes, sir...
Person 1: Do you believe in what we're doing here, Johnson?
Person 2: I can perform my duties, sir.
Person 1: You don't sound very convincing.
Person 2: I am, sir.
Person 1: What exactly do you do in the army, Johnson?
Person 2: I follow orders, I do what I'm told.
Person 1: And who are those giving you orders?
Person 2: Of-officers.
Person 1: And that's it? What about dedication to your country?",441
"Person 1: They are planning to establish a commission to oversee the agency. They want to review all the budgets, and Treadstone holds a fairly significant place in them. What should I do?

Person 2: You need to find a way to hide it. Remind them that Treadstone is just a training program, purely theoretical. You have to handle it somehow.

Person 1: And what if I can't manage?

Person 2: Then I'll have to reveal what Treadstone really is, and you'll have to explain how you allowed it to happen. That doesn't sound like a good backup plan, does it? We'll handle things in the field, and you take care of the budgets.",442
"Person 1: Sal, if you want me to deliver pizzas faster, maybe invest in some better means of transportation. I can't run with pizzas because the cheese slides off and it makes a mess.
Person 2: I didn't say anything like that. Maybe you have something on your conscience? What are you afraid of?
Person 1: I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Person 2: If you say so, maybe there is something to it. Otherwise, you wouldn't react like that.
Person 1: Come on, Sal.
Person 2: Where are we going with this topic?",443
"Person 1: You know, Mr. Helpmann was a very close friend of your father's. Besides, we've known each other for years and could always count on each other. I'm sure he'll help you in the Information Department. I think you'll really like it there. It's a great opportunity to continue what your dad started.
Person 2: Mom, you don't understand me.",444
"Person 1: Someone must have really gone to great lengths to kill my husband. It must be something truly serious.  
Person 2: It's probably about money. I have no idea how they plan to profit from draining the tanks, but there must be a big deal involved.  
Person 1: Listen, I'll give you a salary and an additional five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is behind it. This could change your life, and I will finally have peace.",445
"Person 1: Alright, everything is ready. Do you have the number for Cape Cod?  
Person 2: Relax, Vinnie. I've got everything under control. I could run this shop with my eyes closed.  
Person 1: How long have you been working for me, Auggie?  
Person 2: I don't know, about thirteen, fourteen years.  
Person 1: That's crazy, don't you think? A smart guy like you. Why do you stick with such a dead-end job?  
Person 2: Maybe because I like you so much, boss.  
Person 1: You see. You should have gotten married by now. Settled down, had kids, a stable job.  
Person 2: I almost got married once.  
Person 1: Yeah, I know. With that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.  
Person 2: Ruby McNutt. My one true love.  
Person 1: Sounds like another one of your stories.  
Person 2: She married someone else when I joined the navy. But when I came back, she was already divorced. Her husband gouged out her eye during a fight.  
Person 1: Lovely.  
Person 2: She started coming on to me when I got back, but that glass eye distracted me. Every time we got close, I thought about that hole in her head. An eye that couldn't see, couldn't cry. Whenever I thought about it, Mr. Johnson got soft and small. And I can't imagine marriage if Mr. Johnson isn't in shape.  
Person 1: You don't take anything seriously, do you?  
Person 2: I try not to. It's better for your health. Look at yourself, Vincent. You have a wife, three kids, a house on Long Island. White shoes, white caddy, white carpet. And you've already had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.  
Person 1: I should quit these damn cigarettes. They'll finish me off one day.  
Person 2: Enjoy them while you can, Vin. Soon enough, regulations will finish us off anyway.  
Person 1: They'll catch you smoking tobacco, line you up against a wall, and shoot you.  
Person 2: Today tobacco, tomorrow sex. In a few years, it will be illegal to smile at strangers.  
Person 1: Speaking of which, are you still doing that Montecristo deal?  
Person 2: Everything's set. My guy in Miami says they'll be here in a couple of weeks. Are you sure you don't want to get in on it with me? Five thousand investment, guaranteed ten thousand profit. A consortium of lawyers and judges from Court Street is dreaming of real Cuban cigars.  
Person 1: No, thanks. Do what you want, but don't get caught, okay? I heard it's still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.  
Person 2: That's the beauty of it. The law buys it. When was the last time you heard of a judge putting himself in jail?  
Person 1: Do as you think best. But don't keep those boxes here too long.  
Person 2: They come in, they go out. I've got it planned down to the last detail.  
Person 1: I have to go. Terry will kill me if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.  
Person 2: Sure, man. Say hi to the wife and kids. Send me a postcard if you remember the address.",446
"Person 1: Don't worry about me. You have your own problems.  
Person 2: Do you really want me to forget about you?  
Person 1: I don't want you to suffer because of me.  
Person 2: Daphne, I...",447
"Person 1: Mom, I have a normal job. I'm doing something good for our community and helping people.  
Person 2: When I play bridge with my friends, each of them brags about their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers, doctors, rabbis. Why can't I show off a picture?  
Person 1: Then don't show a picture.  
Person 2: Do you know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a wonderful man. Instead of struggling with saving Hanukkah, maybe you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca too.",448
"Person 1: She shouldn't be here, Sean. Let her go.
Person 2: It's because of you, Hunt, that she's here. Now you're responsible for everything that happens to her. If you really care about her, you'd better convince her to take the weapon and bring it to me. It's all in your hands now, Hunt. What will you do? Nyah is waiting for your decision.",449
"Person 1: I don't know what you were thinking, but I hope you're pleased with yourself. I'm putting myself on the line for you, risking my reputation, and you're putting me in a stupid situation.
Person 2: What are you talking about? What did I do?
Person 1: Who talked you into this? Was it my ex-wife who asked you to do it?
Person 2: Please, calm down --
Person 1: Stop talking to me like that! My name isn't David, and if you really don't understand that, you're more lost than I thought!",450
"Person 1: You really should go to the cemetery. It will change your perspective on many things, and you might regret it someday if you don't go.
Person 2: You better go to sleep now, or else I'll have to come in and have a serious talk with you.
Person 1: Trust me, it's worth listening to me. Someday you might realize that it was an important decision.
Person 2: Alright, but if you don't stop, I'll really have to do something about it.",451
"Person 1: That's not how she told it to me. She said you wrote to her regularly when you were away.  
Person 2: I did write, but not every week...  
Person 1: She claimed that in every letter you confessed your love for her, said you wanted to marry her and have children...  
Person 2: I never said anything like that!  
Person 1: I found those letters, man, and read them myself, right after she did!  
Person 2: Okay, I wrote those things... and yes, I had serious plans with your mom... but when she said she was pregnant, I realized what she was really like. I've dealt with such situations before!  
Person 1: What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you bastard?",452
"Person 1: I just packed, and I already have to leave. I really can't believe it.
Person 2: Oh yes, because everything in your life is one big disaster, and I'm to blame for it. As usual, right?",453
"Person 1: It torments me. I've done terrible things, but I can't see myself as a bad person. I've killed three people, yet I want to believe it was an accident. Do you understand?  
Person 2: If you let me go, I could explain it to others...  
Person 1: Tom Grunemann caught me—we were here on business, and he saw me with Jane McKenna. Then I felt that his contemptuous expression and the certainty that he would use it against me in the company was too much. I held out as long as I could, you understand?  
Person 2: I'm sorry, I'm just scared. Yes, I understand.  
Person 1: Excuse me, Miss Daniel?  
Person 2: I said yes, I understand.  
Person 1: Oh, I don't think you really understand...  
Person 2: Tell me. I'll listen. I just want you to tell me.",454
"Person 1: Tina told me that you want to sell the house, and you didn't even ask for my opinion.
Person 2: What? I never said that. I only mentioned that we might consider it someday.
Person 1: But she was sure about it.
Person 2: Check the facts first before accusing me. We always make decisions together. You know I would never leave you out.",455
"Person 1: What are you doing here?
Person 2: I think you forgot to lock the door.
Person 1: What do you want?
Person 2: See how simple it is? Maybe Mrs. Mayfield also left her door open. And if not, on every floor in the linen room, there is a master key. The head porter has such a key. The bellboy also has such a key. The whole hotel is full of master keys.
Person 1: A master key?
Person 2: Or... if someone is a well-known guest, you just go to the reception and say, ""Mrs. Mayfield seems to have lost her room key - do you have a spare?"" They always have a spare.
Person 1: Don't be stupid. I loved him. He didn't deserve it, but I loved him.
Person 2: And now, when there are no other women, you can keep loving him.
Person 1: You're mean, sarcastic...
Person 2: Sarcastic, if you like, dear. But mean? You're the one who lied about the gun.",456
"Person 1: I would like to go home already.  
Person 2: Can I tell you something important before you go?  
Person 1: What is it?  
Person 2: All of this, this date, was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.  
Person 1: Thank you for telling me.  
Person 2: No, that's not what I mean. I want you to understand, that's why I'm acting this way. It's not me. I hate this role.",457
"Person 1: Alright, I have to go to school, so I guess I better get going.  
Person 2: Why bother? I just saw your report card. Does it even make sense? Better stay home, let's watch something fun on TV, we'll order pizza. What kind of report card is that anyway?  
Person 1: I'm going through a tough time, you know?  
Person 2: Seriously? A tough time? Oh sure, you, Princess Diana, and Madonna, you're all having a hard time, right?",458
"Person 1: How much will you pay me for my help?
Person 2: It's not that simple, young man.
Person 1: Give me something to start with, and I'll show you what I can do.
Person 2: You don't become a police officer overnight. It requires three years of training. Do you understand?
Person 1: I'm ready, I can act. Maybe you'll buy some candy to support youth in need?
Person 2: I'm sorry, young man.
Person 1: Maybe you want my story? I can perform for you, but I need to get paid. I really need to.
Person 2: Why aren't you in school?
Person 1: There are no classes today. The teacher got sick.
Person 2: Don't they have substitutes at your school?
Person 1: No, they don't. So what did you discover?
Person 2: That's confidential information, young man.
Person 1: Tell me what you know, and I'll tell you what I know.
Person 2: No way.
Person 1: Leave it to the detectives, they won't solve anything. I can help you, make you a man with a plan. I have a gift, think quickly. Do you want to know who killed that guy?",459
"Person 1: Remember, you promised... no shenanigans.
Person 2: I promised? I really don't remember that...
Person 1: Oh great, now you're really annoying me.",460
"Person 1: Alright, go ahead, what's this about?
Person 2: I really like your bar.
Person 1: Yeah? So what?
Person 2: I think I should have it.
Person 1: And what does that have to do with anything?
Person 2: Do I need to explain it more bluntly?
Person 1: Harry, this guy can't tell his nose from his ear, and you from a con artist. This bar is my property and has nothing to do with him.
Person 2: It doesn't matter. Remember, you have the opportunity to provide your son with a better life.
Person 1: And you have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But I won't beat around the bush, get lost, Harry!",461
"Person 1: So what? It's just a hamburger.  
Person 2: But there's still a bit of that brown stuff.  
Person 1: Just avoid it.  
Person 2: I don't want to.  
Person 1: Listen, kid. Do you know how hard I worked to get this food on the table?  
Person 2: Doesn't matter. I don't like it. I want pizza.  
Person 1: Forget about pizza. I'm tired of this mess at home. From now on, we're eating normal food, got it?  
Person 2: No!",462
"Person 1: Don't worry about what isn't yours. By the way, I will sew up your pockets, whether you want it or not.  
Person 2: What if I have to sneeze?  
Person 1: Don't worry, you won't sneeze without my permission.",463
"Person 1: Just one more stop – Victoria's Secret – and we'll be ready.
Person 2: But why do I need expensive, fancy lingerie? Shouldn't a guy know he's attracted to me before he sees me in lingerie?
Person 1: It's not about him, it's about you. You'll feel sexy in the lingerie, and that will boost your confidence.
Person 2: I'm not sure...
Person 1: There's a promotion now. It's so nice there – they play classical music, and the atmosphere is relaxing. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, you have nothing to lose.",464
"Person 1: We won't be able to jump over this. We'll break our necks!

Person 2: Relax, nothing will happen to us. I've done this many times and I know exactly how to do it. Just follow me, step by step, don't look down, and don't stop. If you stop, that's when we'll have a problem.

Person 1: I'm not going to climb up there.

Person 2: Give me the cat, I'll handle it.",465
"Person 1: Everything is fine. Molly is just playing.  
Person 2: I wouldn't call it playing. You're playing God at my expense.  
Person 1: Case, you were addicted to drugs. Your pancreas was in terrible condition. You wouldn't have survived a year. We saved your life by freeing you from that addiction.  
Person 2: Thanks, but I liked that addiction.  
Person 1: Well, now you have a new addiction.",466
"Person 1: Where did you get that idea? The management agreed to it.
Person 2: The management didn't know that you are someone trying to sabotage us from the inside.
Person 1: Is this another conspiracy theory from that mysterious advisor of yours? Aren't you tired of his constant insinuations? No one knows who he really is, but everyone has noticed that ever since he showed up, he's been constantly messing with your head.",467
"Person 1: It's all because of you. I really thought that one day you would bring me peace. When your father left, he said you would be my pride. But he was wrong, and now I don't know why to keep living.  
Person 2: Mom, don't say that. We are here for you and we want to help you.",468
"Person 1: What are you saying, Buddy! How can you say something like that? Where did you get that from?  
Person 2: I'm just curious about how it is. It really intrigues me, Rosa.  
Person 1: That's really not okay! Curiosity can lead to trouble.  
Person 2: Yes, but curiosity is a human thing. Can I try?  
Person 1: No! You should be ashamed for even asking!  
Person 2: Can I just a little bit, Rosa? Really just a tiny bit?  
Person 1: Absolutely not! I'm... I'm shocked, Buddy, really! If you don't stop, I'm going back to my place!  
Person 2: Please, Rosa. It's just curiosity, it's natural. You're my friend, right? You like me, right? I really like you, Rosa, I even love you.  
Person 1: You're sweet, but that's not real love.  
Person 2: But I do love you. Please, Rosa, be a good friend.  
Person 1: Buddy, you're still a child.  
Person 2: I'm thirteen. It's normal for me to be curious. It's just nature, Rosa. What's wrong with nature?  
Person 1: Well, nothing.",469
"Person 1: Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't gone through full testing yet. It could be dangerous.
Person 2: I don't care if it's dangerous! In difficult times, radical decisions must be made, Mr. Mackey. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't do it?
Person 1: Fine, I'll call...",470
"Person 1: Do you really care about being noticed by that white horse?  
Person 2: Yes, it was very friendly.  
Person 1: Or is it about something more? Maybe you're feeling a bit lonely? Is that possible, Georgina?",471
"Person 1: When I said that being the best salesperson here isn't a big achievement, I meant that it's not enough. I know your successes at Sarber and Webb, and I consider you a great salesperson, but you lacked challenges. You had no competition, so you didn't have to push yourself. By the way, I'm planning to make changes in the team.

Person 2: I heard.

Person 1: It doesn't matter that they work on commission. If they don't deliver good results, they don't represent us properly, and we can't afford that. Have you ever managed a sales team?

Person 2: Only myself.

Person 1: Exactly, you had to manage yourself. We need a sales manager here. Someone who is not only a great salesperson but also capable of managing a team. You would have a lot of work ahead of you in eliminating unnecessary baggage and hiring new people. What do you think about that?",472
"Person 1: Galvin, listen, many years ago...

Person 2: Don't try to feed me that nonsense like ""I was a lawyer too."" I know exactly who you were. You didn't succeed as a lawyer, you were just an assistant and you still are. I know your past.

Person 1: Are you finished?

Person 2: Of course. I intend to file a motion to have the trial annulled and demand that you be removed from this case. I will forward the record of this conversation to the appropriate authorities and request that you be dismissed.

Person 1: You won't get an annulment, young man. We are finishing this case this afternoon. Now leave before I call security and have you removed.",473
"Person 1: Don't worry, it doesn't make you a bad person.  
Person 2: But that's how I feel.  
Person 1: Really, you shouldn't. I'm glad you're being honest with me.  
Person 2: I feel like I can't win with you.  
Person 1: It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take everything too personally.  
Person 2: I do not.  
Person 1: Try to let go a little.  
Person 2: I'm relaxed. Can we end this now?  
Person 1: Alright.",474
"Person 1: George, look at me... Please, don't lie to me anymore.  
Person 2: Matthew, I need to trust you. I can't manage without your help.",475
"Person 1: We'd better not waste time, because it won't be good.  
Person 2: Are you going to reject me again today?  
Person 1: Remember, if this guy isn't caught, you're going back to prison for the rest of your life.",476
"Person 1: You know, it seems to me that your girlfriend might be a bit problematic. It might be worth considering how to resolve this.
Person 2: I'm not sure if I agree with you...
Person 1: Maybe you don't have all the information. I think I can help you better understand the situation.",477
"Person 1: Do you remember the last time we sat together to have a drink? I was having a milkshake then.
Person 2: What were we talking about then?
Person 1: Actually, we never really talked.
Person 2: Is that a reproach?
Person 1: It's more of a regret. It was just us, Dad. My childhood was lonely. Yours was too. If you had been a father like others, you would understand.
Person 2: I thought I was a great father.
Person 1: When exactly?",478
"Person 1: If you want to know my opinion... yes, I agree.
Person 2: You know, I was thinking about different possibilities... Maybe if you spent the night with Simon, then...
Person 1: A night with Simon?
Person 2: It's just one of the options, really...
Person 1: Is that why you brought me here? Do you really think that's okay? Who do you think I am, that you can treat me like this?
Person 2: I don't even know why I suggested it... It was the first thing that came to mind... Look, you kiss him, he says he loves you. You get along great. But if you don't want to... okay... Forget what I said about Simon. It was stupid.
Person 1: I will never forget that you said that.
Person 2: I know, it was a mistake.",479
"Person 1: Hi, Buddy. Has it been a year already? You're not planning to hit me up for money for NYU again, are you?  
Person 2: We're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I heard you got a promotion. Are you a partner already? Not bad. How's Margie?  
Person 1: I can't complain. We have a house in Oyster Bay. How's the market treating you? Still seeing that beautiful French woman?  
Person 2: No, she asked one wrong question.  
Person 1: What question was that?  
Person 2: ""What are you thinking about?""... and that was the end. Work is tough, but the money is starting to come in. I know a guy who has a sure way to make money, can't lose.  
Person 1: Does ""this guy"" have any tips for an honest lawyer?  
Person 2: Sure, check out Teldar Paper, it's not over yet.  
Person 1: Okay.  
Person 2: How about you? I heard you're involved in the Fairchild Foods merger and it might not go through. Any surprises I won't find in the Wall Street Journal?  
Person 1: Come on, Buddy, you don't want me to lose my law license, do you?  
Person 2: Who's listening to us? It's just a conversation between two old friends.  
Person 1: Right...  
Person 2: Relax, Roger, everyone does it. But you know nothing, you know nothing.  
Person 1: ...and if I did know, what would be in it for me?",480
"Person 1: Why do you need that?  
Person 2: It's for those dark circles under your eyes. You're really handsome, but it's worth taking care of yourself a bit sometimes, you know?  
Person 1: I don't know... I don't deal with things like that.  
Person 2: Maybe it's worth a try! When you look good, you feel better, and it affects others too.  
Person 1: Well, I don't know if it's my role to cheer everyone up.  
Person 2: Okay, I didn't mean to push. I'm sorry if that was out of line.",481
"Person 1: Brutus, the fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves...
Person 2: Don't try to convince me of that. It's my business.
Person 1: And it's really important!
Person 2: I can suspend you, revoke your right to practice.
Person 1: Don't threaten me, Miles. I haven't done anything illegal.
Person 2: Why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Person 1: I'm sorry, Miles, but that's a professional secret. As they say, what's permitted to the governor...",482
"Person 1: Your fear of him was justified. You know that fear is the most powerful tool. It can be used to break someone.
Person 2: How could you exploit people like that? What you did is cruel!",483
"Person 1: Do you know what you've gotten yourself into? You were involved in the scandal on 47th Street, right by Maxie's. You and Coleman were up to something, and then you sent a guy to 49th Street. The problem is, that was Doyle Lonnegan's courier. That changes everything.

Person 2: You're crazy. I'm not stupid enough to get involved in mob business.

Person 1: Maybe it was unintentional, but Lonnegan doesn't care. He can destroy you without batting an eye.

Person 2: I'll find someone to help me clear up this situation.

Person 1: No one will protect you if I point you out as the guilty one.",484
"Person 1: You know, I think I made a mistake trying to talk to you. Don't you remember what we promised each other? Honesty and trust! How can you just ignore that?

Person 2: Come on, this has nothing to do with honesty. You just need to get a good night's sleep. When you toss and turn all night, even I can't fall asleep.",485
"Person 1: Don't forget about your CDs.  
Person 2: They're not mine.  
Person 1: Of course they are.  
Person 2: They really aren't. I know you bought them for me, which was very nice, but that was when you were trying to make me adapt to you. I can't take them because they would just sit there and remind me of that. They don't fit with the rest of my things, you understand? That Sting album you gave me was a great gift. I like Sting, and you can't stand him. But the rest... Who is this Nick Lowe? Or Gram Parsons? Or Boredoms? I don't know them. I...  
Person 1: Okay, okay. I get it.  
Person 2: Sorry for going on like that. But I feel there's a lesson here, and I want you to understand it.  
Person 1: I understand. You like Sting, but you don't like Gram Parsons because you don't know him.  
Person 2: You're being deliberately difficult.  
Person 1: I guess so.  
Person 2: Well, think about it.",486
"Person 1: You know, I was hoping you would understand my situation...
Person 2: Really? Is that all you want to tell me?
Person 1: But I'm just trying to...
Person 2: Seriously? Do you always only think about yourself? Maybe it's time to think about others.",487
"Person 1: You know what will happen if you're wrong... Maybe you'll finally decide to tell the truth.  
Person 2: What do you mean?  
Person 1: I want to know why Ganz escaped. It couldn't have been just for freedom. I have a feeling you know more than you're saying.  
Person 2: I really don't know what you're talking about. I just want Ganz to face the consequences of his actions.  
Person 1: Well, in that case, our agreement doesn't make sense.",488
"Person 1: Do you really think it works? Or maybe you've never even tried it? Admit it, you don't approach girls, do you? You're the quiet, sensitive type, but if I give you a chance, maybe I'll discover the real you: funny, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little crazy, a little naughty... but we all like guys like that, right?
Person 2: Uh-
Person 1: What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
Person 2: I think I left something where -",489
"Person 1: I was thinking about a new approach to the project.  
Person 2: Ella, that's a really bad idea. Everyone else agrees with me, no one has any doubts about it.  
Person 1: Really? No one told me about this.  
Person 2: Maybe they're too polite to say it directly. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.",490
"Person 1: You can't handle anything. You better get some money by Tuesday... anything. Understand? Stick to that paycheck this week.  
Person 2: There won't be a paycheck this week.  
Person 1: What are you talking about?  
Person 2: I didn't go to work.  
Person 1: Are you sick or what? Did you forget how hard we worked to get you that job, you fool?  
Person 2: I don't like loading crates.  
Person 1: You don't have to like it. Your attitude is killing me. Listen... you need to be there tomorrow.  
Person 2: And what about your attitude... Where's your job? You just talk, and I go to work... what do you do?  
Person 1: I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anyone 2,000 plus interest, you fool. You show up, or I'll deal with you, got it?  
Person 2: Okay, okay... calm down. I'll show up. On Tuesday, I'll give Michael something. I promise.  
Person 1: Don't promise... just do it.  
Person 2: Alright, now that we've got that settled... what will you make me for breakfast?",491
"Person 1: Joe, you know it was just a mistake, right? Seriously, we would never hurt you. Trust me.  
Person 2: No, it wasn't a mistake. It was done deliberately.  
Person 1: But why would we want to hurt you? We're friends, Joe.  
Person 2: Not you. Them.  
Person 1: Who do you mean? Think about it, it doesn't make sense.  
Person 2: I don't know exactly who.",492
"Person 1: Wait a moment. Slow down. A film of this type, on 16mm, costs about two, three hundred dollars. It's sold as property, can be watched on special machines, sometimes in theaters, but not always. It's practically untraceable. 'No one' produces it, 'no one' shows it, 'no one' sees it. As if it didn't exist at all.  
Person 2: What's it called?  
Person 1: When I bought it, it was called 'Slave of Love'. The next time it's sold, it'll probably get a different name.  
Person 2: And what about the police...  
Person 1: The police? They know even less than you do.  
Person 2: Do you think she's safe?  
Person 1: Yes. I'm sure.  
Person 2: You like this, don't you? Showing me... this.  
Person 1: I hate it. But you need to know, man. There are a lot of strange things happening in the world. Things you have no idea about in Grand Rapids. Things better left unknown. There are doors that should never be opened. I know more about this than a person should. Don't ask why.",493
"Person 1: It's great that you take care of your things. But think about why you wouldn't protect what belongs to you.

Person 2: I don't think you understood me well.

Person 1: Actually, I do understand you, Alan. The problem is that what you think is yours actually belongs to me. And no matter how long it takes, I will get it back. So for your own good, don't get too attached to this place, because soon, maybe even very soon, you, your French antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little kingdom will have to leave this office.",494
"Person 1: If only Armand gave a sign, you would leave me for him, wouldn't you?  
Person 2: Never in my life!  
Person 1: He wants you, just as you want him. He's waiting for you. Everything around him seems dull and lifeless, just like it does for us.  
Person 2: That's not true.  
Person 1: Do you know what his soul told me when he hypnotized me?  
Person 2: So you felt it too!  
Person 1: ""Let him go"" – that's what he said. ""Let him go.""",495
"Person 1: I don't care what you think.
Person 2: Seriously, Mr. Cluett, you can't treat her like that. Don't you really want to reconsider? You're going to get yourself into serious trouble.
Person 1: I'm telling you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Person 2: Really? And what about the fact that Mrs. Dickson is obsessed with you? No one knows this better than you. If she finds out, it will destroy him.",496
"Person 1: Mom, it's not Rachel's fault that I ran away.  
Person 2: Maybe not, but she should take better care of my beloved son. That's her most important task, right?  
Person 1: Rachel has her own job.  
Person 2: Ben, moms have jobs too. And very hard ones. Being a mom is harder than a professional job, except I don't get paid for it.  
Person 1: Does Rachel earn well?  
Person 2: Well, people who only think about themselves often have quite a bit of money.  
Person 1: I think she's pretty, mom.

Person 2: Yes, darling?

"Person 1: Zach, how are things progressing on the forty-fourth floor?
Person 2: Not too well, boss. It seems we have too many sensitive souls here. Did we take over a bank or some kind of charity organization?
Person 1: Calm down, in time they'll understand that there's no joking with the First Bank. It's a serious matter, and we have to hold on tight. My father always said that the strongest survive.
Person 2: I thought Darwin or Nietzsche said that, boss.
Person 1: Maybe so. I spent so many years in boarding school that it's hard to remember everything. Do you have the recording of the latest... events?
Person 2: Yes, boss. Yesterday's, straight from the park.
Person 1: I'm glad I can always count on you.
Person 2: Thank you, boss. Can I ask something?
Person 1: Of course.
Person 2: Since our little ""hobbies"" aren't a problem, maybe you'd consider something more peaceful, like a yacht club?
Person 1: Zach, how old are you?
Person 2: Thirty-two.
Person 1: And how much do you earn annually?
Person 2: About four hundred thousand.
Person 1: Zach, I can spend your annual salary in one day. I've always had that kind of money. If I wanted, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon. My father founded this company over seventy years ago, and when my brother couldn't run it, it was entrusted to me. Managing such a bank is stressful. I need to relax in the little time I have. A yacht club won't lower my blood pressure. Understand?
Person 2: Yes, boss.
Person 1: I've entrusted you with a lot. During your time here, you've seen and heard things that could shake the entire financial world. Such loyalty should be rewarded.
Person 2: Thank you, boss.",498
"Person 1: Please, stop... I don't understand why you're dragging me into this. I was happy. You said you weren't satisfied with me.
Person 2: What? That's not true. I'm not dissatisfied. I really need you more than you think. Without you, everything falls apart.",499
"Person 1: Why did you tell me to flood the school?  
Person 2: We just want to guide you onto the right path.  
Person 1: Who are you?  
Person 2: You will find out soon.  
Person 1: How did you get here?  
Person 2: Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?",500
"Person 1: She's a nun, Vince.  
Person 2: Chris, I love you and always will. I have given you so much - my time, my feelings, and even a promising career. How do you repay me for that? Where is your loyalty and love?",501
"Person 1: Is that your answer, man? You think you're so tough?  
Person 2: Luke, calm down... We're in a tight spot. There are tons of people outside—police, sheriffs, all armed to the teeth. We don't stand a chance, Luke. They caught me right after we split up, and they wanted to get you. But I managed to negotiate that if you surrender, they won't hurt you this time.  
Person 1: And what about our beds?  
Person 2: Sure, Luke. I didn't ask about that, but I'm sure we can sort it out. They're reasonable, Luke. It's only a few hours, after all.  
Person 1: You really don't get it, do you?  
Person 2: Luke, you have to trust me. Just surrender, calmly and without any fuss.  
Person 1: Like always?  
Person 2: Exactly. Just do it...",502
"Person 1: Do you remember when you dropped that glass?  
Person 2: What? I...  
Person 1: It was just a cheap catering glass. Then you started crying, and I tried to calm you down...  
Person 2: In the living room, right?  
Person 1: Yes, but you pushed me away and ran out to the terrace. Then I drove you home.  
Person 2: But why? I can't understand how I could just...  
Person 1: It was shortly after the accident, remember? We were moving at the time. It was a really tough time for us.  
Person 2: But I don't remember that...  
Person 1: Honey, it was over a year ago. It's normal not to remember everything.  
Person 2: What's wrong with me?  ",503
"Person 1: And what if it turns out that there's only a wasteland there? How do you plan to survive there?
Person 2: You won't be able to survive there. Do you know what awaits you there, Taylor? You'll live like an animal. If the apes don't hunt you down, some jungle beast will devour you.",504
"Person 1: Come outside and talk to me, you bastard!  
Person 2: Stop it! It looks like you're under the influence of alcohol or something else. This is going to end badly.  
Person 1: I'm not!  
Person 2: You better calm down, or you'll regret it.  
Person 1: Don't try to intimidate me!  
Person 2: You'll wake up the whole neighborhood if you don't calm down!  
Person 1: Don't try to intimidate me!",505
"Person 1: Hand over what you have and get out of here, because you really don't want to know what will happen if you don't.  
Person 2: Is it true that you had women on your conscience?  
Person 1: Seventeen, of which eleven were accidents. And now, you'd better hurry up and do what I say. You too, move it!",506
"Person 1: But does it really matter whether he was your boyfriend or not?  
Person 2: Of course it does! It changes everything.  
Person 1: Why do you think that? You'll never find out anyway.  
Person 2: I will find out, for sure!  
Person 1: I don't think so. How would you find out?  
Person 2: I'll just feel it!  
Person 1: You won't remember it, trust me.  
Person 2: When it happens, I'll know. It will be something different.  
Person 1: I used to think that too. I was sure you'd remember, but you won't.",507
"Person 1: That's nice, thank you. You're my sister's friend, right?  
Person 2: Yes, we've known each other for about six months.  
Person 1: Do you like her?  
Person 2: Yes, we get along well. And you?  
Person 1: Did you come here to meet me, or do you have another reason?  
Person 2: No, I really wanted to meet you.  
Person 1: That's good. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about various promotions and collaborations between companies. Have you heard about this pudding promotion?  
Person 2: Yes, it rings a bell.  
Person 1: I bought it thanks to a promotion sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. The idea is to encourage people to travel and buy their products, like frozen meals or soups.  
Person 2: I see.  
Person 1: You know, for purchasing 10 Healthy Choice products, you get 500 airline miles, and with a coupon, even 1000. I found their soup in the store for 3.50 zł, but the real deal is the pudding at 1 zł per cup. Each cup has its own barcode, which can be exchanged for miles. Do you get what I mean?  
Person 2: Yes, I'm starting to understand.  
Person 1: Imagine, if you spend 12,000 zł on pudding, you can get over a million miles.  
Person 2: That sounds crazy. Do you really spend that much on pudding?  
Person 1: No, not me. It's my friend Carlos. He's crazy about it. I was just advising him.  
Person 2: Your sister told me a funny story about you, how you were building a ramp for a dog and accidentally threw a hammer through a window. Is that true?",508
"Person 1: What was that supposed to mean?  
Person 2: You're just impossible.  
Person 1: Why did you hit me?  
Person 2: Have you ever wondered how many people I've had close relationships with?  
Person 1: And what if you tell me, can I hit you?  
Person 2: Three.  
Person 1: Three?  
Person 2: Yes, three, including you.  
Person 1: Only three?  
Person 2: It's not me who's the problem, it's you.  
Person 1: Who?  
Person 2: You!  
Person 1: No, who was it, besides me?  
Person 2: John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.  
Person 1: Well, that's something.  
Person 2: I'm proud of it. That's why you should be ashamed. You guys are incorrigible, ready for anything.  
Person 1: Any other categories?  
Person 2: Like a vegetable, meaning someone who's passive.  
Person 1: Easier targets.  
Person 2: After all this, you owe me something. And quite a lot.  
Person 1: Okay. What do you want?  
Person 2: I want you to come with me on Monday.  
Person 1: Where to?  
Person 2: To school. There's a seminar about returning to studies after a break.  
Person 1: Can we ever talk without getting into this topic?  
Person 2: It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential, and you're wasting it. I wish you'd go back to school.  
Person 1: For God's sake, stop. My head is splitting from this.",509
"Person 1: Maybe you can tell us, Bright Eyes, what the second Article of Faith says?
Person 2: To be honest, I'm not familiar with your culture.
Person 1: Well, that's probably because you can't think for yourself. Maybe you can explain to us why all monkeys are equal?
Person 2: It seems to me that some monkeys are more equal than others.
Person 1: That's absurd. You're contradicting yourself. Tell me, Bright Eyes, why do you claim that humans don't have souls? What evidence do you have that the divine spark is present in a monkey's brain?
Person 2: Maybe it would be better for the President to handle this.",510
"Person 1: I know you feel the same, so don't pretend it's otherwise.
Person 2: Really, I have to go now. I have a dentist appointment that I can't reschedule.",511
"Person 1: Where is my parachute?! What happened to it?!
Person 2: Relax, I don't think Superman would fall for something like that.
Person 1: That's great, but where is my parachute?
Person 2: I'm wearing it.
Person 1: I'm talking about the backup one!
Person 2: Backup? What are you talking about?
Person 1: You can't do this to me!
Person 2: Oh, but I can. You know I love you.",512
"Person 1: I know whose blood you need to lift the curse.  
Person 2: Tell me right away, or else I can't be held responsible for my actions!  
Person 1: You won't do it. I know you need me more than you want to admit.",513
"Person 1: That's exactly the point.
Person 2: What is?
Person 1: I once bought a pair of earrings because I thought they would look great on you. I was going to give them to you if you said or did something nice. It's been six months, and I haven't heard a single nice word from you. That's really a long time.
Person 2: I'm sorry. I just work a lot...
Person 1: I know, but still. Six months is a long time. Maybe you should reconsider your job or the relationship. There are guys who don't mind being second, but I'm not one of them.
Person 2: I can't quit my job, George.
Person 1: Of course you can. People change jobs all the time.
Person 2: I can't. This job is the best thing that's happened to me. I finally feel like people respect me. Everyone at the company listens to what I have to say. I've never experienced that before. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it.
Person 1: More than me?
Person 2: I need it.",514
"Person 1: Calm down. Stop worrying. Think about this: billions of galaxies with countless stars, and we are just a speck of dust on one of them... Lost in space. Does it really matter? The policeman, you, me... Who cares?
Person 2: What's going on with you?
Person 1: What do you mean?
Person 2: Listen, if someone forced you to reveal what's happening with others, threatening your life, you wouldn't have a clue... Neither about yourself nor about others. Do you really believe you deserve to wake up every morning? That you'll open your eyes and something will change? I doubt it... You seem to be at rock bottom in your own judgment. How did it come to this?
Person 1: Of all the drivers in LA, I end up with you, Max, a man who sees everything through...
Person 2: Answer the question.
Person 1: Look at your life. Daily routine filled with small savings, dreams of a journey that will never happen. How much have you saved already?
Person 2: That's none of your business.
Person 1: Dreams that will never come true. One day you'll wake up and realize that time has passed and nothing has changed. Life has deceived you. Tomorrow became yesterday. Then you'll fool yourself into thinking it was never meant to happen, and you'll numb yourself in front of the TV for the rest of your life. Don't talk to me about murder. You're killing yourself... in that yellow cage you call a taxi. Punching the clock every day...",515
"Person 1: Mom, did you know there's a secret tunnel leading from the crypt to the barn? That's how she escaped.  
Person 2: That sounds ridiculous. How would she know about it?  
Person 1: Someone must have told her.  
Person 2: Who, exactly? That tunnel hasn't been used in half a century.  
Person 1: Mom, are you hiding something?  
Person 2: Why would I be hiding anything?  
Person 1: We're talking about a murder. Aren't you worried about what she said about the person who was in her room?  
Person 2: I'm mostly worried about her health.  
Person 1: Who was that person, mom? Was it you?  
Person 2: If you think there was a murder, you should report it to the prosecutor, not me. And certainly not to Agnes.",516
"Person 1: The police asked me for help. What was I supposed to do?  
Person 2: You could have started by being honest with me. We work together, and I need to trust you.  
Person 1: I admit I handled it poorly. Sanderson didn't want to talk to me... but you are young, attractive—  
Person 2: —just like that girl who was murdered. For heaven's sake, Alan, that guy could have been a psychopath.  
Person 1: They asked who was best suited for the task, and you—  
Person 2: Don't patronize me! You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't even warn me!",517
"Person 1: Paweł, I saw someone leaving the room. It must have been you.  
Person 2: What? No, I didn't leave the room.  
Person 1: Paweł, you know that my ceramic penguin in the study always faces south. Now it's moved.  
Person 2: I really don't know what you're talking about.",518
"Person 1: Frankie, you're a family man, right?  
Person 2: Yes, I have a wife and a daughter. My father is still alive too. Sometimes I think he'll outlive us all, especially when the Mets tie the game. It was just a matter of time, right?  
Person 1: Have you ever wondered how many years we spend ensuring our family's safety and happiness, and then in a moment, everything can be destroyed?  
Person 2: I don't know what you're getting at. What do you mean?  
Person 1: Sometimes we hurt those who love us the most, no matter who we are or what we do. We say we want control over our lives, but do we really want it? Maybe deep down, we long to lose it. Jesus understands this.",519
"Person 1: Where is she? Tell me immediately!
Person 2: And who are you to ask me that?
Person 1: Who am I? You better talk, or you'll be in trouble. Where did you get that car?!
Person 2: I won't say anything more until my lawyer arrives.",520
"Person 1: Thank you.  
Person 2: What do you think about it?  
Person 1: What's going on, Duff?  
Person 2: Listen, darling, I don't know about you, but it makes sense to me. I just feel it. So, what do you say?  
Person 1: Don't pressure me, Duff.  
Person 2: I know living with me wouldn't be easy. I'm not simple to deal with.  
Person 1: What about that girl?  
Person 2: She means nothing to me. That's in the past. I really care about this, darling—I want to be with you. You're not expecting a big scene, are you?  
Person 1: No. But something small would be nice.",521
"Person 1: I can't do it.
Person 2: Think about whether you really want to mend the relationship with your friend. If he is right, this might be your only chance to improve the situation. Don't waste it, because later it might be too late.",522
"Person 1: You made a laughingstock out of me! You lied to me, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised, because lying is your specialty. How do you even distinguish truth from lies? How can you live with that?

Person 2: You're judging me? Now that's ironic! You lie to everyone around you, even to yourself. And now you dare accuse me? You're the one who hired someone to pretend to be your boyfriend. Isn't that hypocrisy?",523
"Person 1: Okay, I understand. What's your name?  
Person 2: And why do you want to know that?  
Person 1: Give me a name so I know what to call you.  
Person 2: Call me Young.  
Person 1: Young, one word?  
Person 2: Yes, one word. You won't find it on social media.  
Person 1: Can I just call you Young?  
Person 2: Call me whatever you want.  
Person 1: Alright, Young, I want to make sure the people in the bank are safe, and then try to get them out of there. I'll approach unarmed... you can search me to see that you can trust me. I want us to be able to talk and find a solution.  
Person 2: I'll search you?  
Person 1: Yes, you'll search me.  
Person 2: Okay, I get it.  
Person 1: I'd also like some sign that I can trust you, Young. I don't want to risk you shooting me. Some gesture... what do you say?  
Person 2: Sure... I'm not going to shoot you.  
Person 1: Maybe you could let the people out of the bank? Why keep them there?  
Person 2: They protect me. You think I'm stupid? Let's talk.  
Person 1: Okay, at least give us the women.  
Person 2: No... The women are all we have.  
Person 1: I'm trying to be reasonable; give me something... At least one person...  
Person 2: So you want me to release one... Alright. I'll see what I can do.",524
"Person 1: Pass me those documents.  
Person 2: Here you go. And will I ever be able to take control of these projects?  
Person 1: When I decide you're ready for it.  
Person 2: And when will that be?  
Person 1: When you're ready.  
Person 2: Listen, you need to start trusting me. I'm a trustworthy person.  
Person 1: Trust has to be earned, it can't just be given.  
Person 2: Respect is earned, trust can be given to anyone.  
Person 1: Not here. I'll trust you when I feel it's the right time. It's not personal, it's about safety.

Person 1: No.",525
"Person 1: What is this place? Do you have some fascination with swans? Would you like to talk about it?  
Person 2: Lately, I've been thinking about what you said about my painting. I couldn't sleep, pondering it, until something finally came to me and I fell asleep peacefully. Do you know what it was?  
Person 1: I have no idea.  
Person 2: I realized that you're still young. Maybe you don't fully understand what you're talking about.  
Person 1: Thanks for your honesty.  
Person 2: You've never left Boston, have you?  
Person 1: No, I haven't had the chance.  
Person 2: If I asked you about art, you could tell me about every book you've read. You probably know Michelangelo well – his works, ambitions. But do you know what the Sistine Chapel smells like? You've never been there, have you? And what about women? Maybe you have some experiences, but do you know what it's really like to love?  
If I asked you about war, you might list many facts, but you've never experienced it firsthand. You've never held a dying friend in your arms. And love? Maybe you recite sonnets, but have you ever truly felt vulnerable, looking into the eyes of a loved one?  
You haven't experienced true loss, because that requires loving something more than yourself. I see a young man in you, who is still learning. But you assume you know everything about me because you saw my painting. Isn't that right, Will? And yet you're an orphan, aren't you?",526
"Person 1: I used to be full of ambition, I didn't know rest. At the ballet school in Petersburg, we were trained like soldiers. I was small, but tough as a diamond. And then fame came, and with it loneliness... But why am I telling you this? Yesterday I didn't know you. Who are you, really?

Person 2: I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern, but everyone calls me Flix.

Person 1: Flix. What is your life like? Who are you?

Person 2: I'm a bit like a black sheep. Maybe I'll end up on the gallows.

Person 1: Really?

Person 2: Yes, I lack character. I'm not proud of it.

Person 1: No?

Person 2: As a child, I was taught to ride horses and be a gentleman. In the monastery school, I learned to pray and... lie. Then the war came...

Person 1: And?

Person 2: In the war, I learned to kill and hide. That's it.

Person 1: And now?

Person 2: Now I'm a gambler. I live like a free spirit, doing what I want. Maybe I should be in prison.

Person 1: What a story! What else?

Person 2: Sometimes I'm a criminal, a hotel thief.

Person 1: That must be a joke.

Person 2: Look at me. You have to believe me. I really love you. I didn't know what love was until yesterday.

Person 1: What's happening?",527
"Person 1: Mr. Rasczak.  
Person 2: Rasczak? What a strange surname. Schools shouldn't be places for recruitment!  
Person 1: Oh, not at all, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that. He even discourages it; I really admire him.  
Person 2: Great, but you're going to Harvard anyway. End of discussion.  
Person 1: I'm eighteen years old. It's my decision, not yours.  
Person 2: Oh, really? We'll see who really has a say here.",528
"Person 1: You know, sometimes I get the feeling that you could do something really dangerous without even realizing it.  
Person 2: What do you mean? That sounds like some kind of joke. Goodnight, darling.  
Person 1: Well, you know, you could have entered that room just as easily as you came in here. How do I know it wasn't you who hurt Larry?  
Person 2: And what would be my motive for that?  
Person 1: Well, sometimes you can be really sharp-tongued. Maybe you would finally move from words to actions? You didn't like him — and I know why.  
Person 2: He was hard to like. If you look in the mirror when you're in a better mood, maybe you'll understand why.",529
"Person 1: Is it really all because of that telenovela? My son is dead because you came here for that ""doctor""? Are you pretending that it was a good decision?
Person 2: I wouldn't put it that way, but...

"Person 1: So now you believe in Zero too?  
Person 2: I need to get to Amarillo quickly.  
Person 1: Did you tell Richard Low about Amarillo?  
Person 2: I can't. The chat won't be available for another five days.  
Person 1: We'll wait. Contact Low, tell him about the Zero route — we'll set a trap for him.  
Person 2: And what about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?  
Person 1: Hawkins is not the target, Richard Low is the target.  
Person 2: There's a murderer there — we know who he is. He might already be following someone.

Person 1: That's only until you get into the local school.

Person 1: You'll come home on weekends. And now, please stop complaining, or else you'll have to walk.",533
"Person 1: Admit it, K always unsettled you, right? In 1942, he was only thirty-four, and you were already fifty-six. Goebbels and Goering kept telling you, ""If you don't do it, the young K certainly will."" Forget about art, politics, and all those talks about freedom and justice, because I don't care how great you are. It's an old story - the old master jealous of the young wolf. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you could was the fear that you would be replaced by the prodigy, the Party's favorite, the brilliant K.

Person 2: That's absolute nonsense!

Person 1: I'm just getting started. In classical music, is this called developing a theme? They played on your insecurities. It's understandable. But there's someone who dislikes little K as much as you do - yes, number one, your old acquaintance, Adolf. He thinks you're the best. When he says he wants Wilhelm for his birthday, Wilhelm must be present. Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you think: ""To hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf for his birthday in Berlin."" That's how they manipulated you, grabbed you by the throat, and squeezed. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why did you become the standard-bearer of their regime? Jealousy?

Person 2: Of course, there was a campaign against me - even abroad.",534
"Person 1: Hey, sister...
Person 2: You know, you've caused quite a bit of trouble. Life in Giang Hu is no fairy tale. If you really consider me a sister, let me give you some good advice. You can run away from marriage, but not from family.
Person 1: They forced me into marriage!
Person 2: First, go back to your parents. Then you'll decide what to do about Lo.
Person 1: You knew about Lo?
Person 2: He really loves you. Come with me to Beijing, we'll find a solution.
Person 1: And where is he now?
Person 2: Li Mu Bai took care of it. Lo is now on Mount Wudan.
Person 1: You're plotting behind my back! I'm leaving!
Person 2: How can you accuse us of that? I always knew it was you who stole the sword, but I protected you and your family. And you repay me with disdain. Even Li Mu Bai spared you, and you only insult him. We wanted some peace, and you destroyed everything! You're no sister to me!
Person 1: What do I care? You were never a true friend. But I wonder how long you'll last as my enemy?",535
"Person 1: I love it when everything goes according to plan.
Person 2: What do you want from me?

Person 2: My name is Lydia. It seems to me that we have a lot in common.  
Person 1: You said you know where my fiancé was that night.  
Person 2: He was with me. We've been meeting after work three, sometimes four times a week for two months. We have... a close relationship.  
Person 1: How do I know you're telling the truth?  
Person 2: Have you noticed that he's been sleeping in a T-shirt lately? That's to hide the nail marks on his back. You probably didn't know he likes a little pain. He didn't know at first either.  
Person 1: I don't know what you want—  
Person 2: I thought you should know the truth.  
Person 1: And you should know that Sketchy warned me about you. I know you threatened him that if he didn't break up with me, you'd do something yourself.  
Person 2: Oh?  
Person 1: Well, it's over between you two. We're getting married next month.  
Person 2: How sweet. You're standing by your man, even after what he did. You're very understanding.  
Person 1: Love is also about the ability to forgive.  
Person 2: You're naive.  
Person 1: I think you should leave now.  
Person 2: Not before we clear this up, you stuck-up little bitch. I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend. Not him, and certainly not you. Unless you want to find out how sharp these nails are.",537
"Person 1: I'm not sure... Your wife went through all of this... She doesn't believe in your illness... Doubts are destroying her... And what about the insulin?
Person 2: It's not me, it's Sammy! I told you about Sammy.
Person 1: You keep telling yourself that. Over and over. You're trying to convince yourself to believe it. Like ""learning by repetition,"" right?
Person 2: Sammy let his wife die! He ended up in a mental institution!
Person 1: Sammy was a fraud. He was faking it.
Person 2: I never said he was faking it! I never said that!
Person 1: But you exposed him, revealed his true nature.",538
"Person 1: Who are you anyway? What are you doing here? Why shouldn't I just throw you out of here?
Person 2: Listen, I have money...
Person 1: I have money too. So what?
Person 2: I'll give you a thousand dollars. I have it with me.
Person 1: Maybe I'll just take it myself.
Person 2: Just tell me where she is.",539
"Person 1: That belongs to me, Mrs. Lampert. If you don't give it back to me, you can expect serious trouble. Do you understand what I mean?
Person 2: Please, stop! I'm begging you!
Person 1: Think it over carefully, Mrs. Lampert. Is it really worth the risk?",540
"Person 1: Stu, is that you? Where have you been?
Person 2: Me? Nowhere. I was sleeping.
Person 1: Honey, please, don't lie to me. I know you went out.
Person 2: Really, no. Maybe you imagined it.",541
"Person 1: Rose, the situation is really serious. We've truly run out of money.
Person 2: I know, you don't have to keep reminding me.
Person 1: Your father left us only debts, even though everyone thinks we have a great name. That name is the only thing that can save us now.",542
"Person 1: ...The interest is growing week by week.  
Person 2: I know, for six months I've been working just to pay off the interest.  
Person 1: You're still short seventy.  
Person 2: Wait, think about it. You don't have to destroy anything. Take my coat, it's worth 50-60 dollars. It's yours.",543
"Person 1: Oh, Andy...
Person 2: Please, don't cry.
Person 1: I can't help it. You don't know what it's like...
Person 2: Darling, you can't keep going through this. Pack your things and your skates, and we'll go to my family in the countryside. You'll rest there.
Person 1: I can't do that.
Person 2: You have to stop thinking about it, it's destroying you.
Person 1: You're sweet, but the only thing you can do is leave.
Person 2: Leave? What are you saying?
Person 1: And never look for me again, please.
Person 2: I don't understand, why?
Person 1: You can't get involved in this. It's too dangerous.
Person 2: Do you think I care? I want to be with you, that's all that matters.
Person 1: I can't marry you! I never will be able to!
Person 2: Dorothy, why are you saying that?
Person 1: How would you feel having children who could be... murderers? That would be a tragedy. They might hurt themselves... Father should have killed Gilbert and me, then we wouldn't have to go through this.
Person 2: You're talking like someone in shock...
Person 1: Why not? My family is... crazy.
Person 2: Dorothy, listen to me. I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you and I want to be with you.
Person 1: Please, leave!",544
"Person 1: You know, sometimes we hurt the ones we truly love the most.  
Person 2: Or maybe the ones we can't let go of?  
Person 1: Maybe you're right, but one thing I know for sure... You love me, just as I love you.  
Person 2: Yes, I love you. Maybe we should leave everything behind and start anew, together.",545
"Person 1: Why do you say that?  
Person 2: If you don't care, why are you so calm when it happens?  
Person 1: Are you sure? Maybe that's just the way I am.  
Person 2: Come on! What's so special about it? It's a nice place, but there are others just as good. It's not about the money, at least not for you. Why can't I understand it? Cobb claims that no one knows what really interests you.  
Person 1: Did he really say that? Well, this time he's right.",546
"Person 1: I feel unwell. What do you want from me?  
Person 2: I have my eye on a few guys who look dangerous. Dirty, tattooed, unruly. That's your scene, right?  
Person 1: And what's in it for me?  
Person 2: If you find out what I need and I can use it, you'll return to your old life. If not, you'll face serious problems.  
Person 1: You're a sick bastard. Some sadist with a badge who wants to drag me into a suicide mission. I think that no matter what I do, I'll end up badly. So here's my answer.",547
"Person 1: Listen, you need to do one thing. Take the bag of money out of your backpack, count out five thousand dollars, and give it to Auggie.
Person 2: What are you talking about? You can't be serious.
Person 1: I'm absolutely serious. You need to settle the debt with Auggie. Since you won't be paying Creeper back, you can use the money to deal with Auggie. It's really a better option. It's better to have friends than to worry about enemies.
Person 2: I'm not going to do it.
Person 1: You will do it, and quickly. You've messed up, and now you have to fix it. That's how it works, man. If you don't do it, you're out of here. Understand? If you don't pay Auggie what he's owed, it's over for you.
Person 2: I'll pay Auggie, but I'll be left with nothing. Just eight hundred dollars and a one-way ticket to Misery City.
Person 1: Don't worry. You have friends now, remember? Just stick to the rules, and everything will work out.",549
"Person 1: My... mother...?
Person 2: Yes, Rowan. You need to listen to me. Your lawyer should contact me as soon as possible. It's urgent.
Person 1: But my mother... Ellie said she died...
Person 2: I understand, but...
Person 1: Ellie said she died when I was born! Has she been alive all this time? Why was I lied to?
Person 2: I was the one who decided to send you away.
Person 1: Who the hell are you?
Person 2: It was necessary, because of the situation. I know this is a shock for you, but really, Rowan, you never knew her. It's not like you lost something great...
Person 1: What is wrong with you? What kind of person are you?
Person 2: I'm exhausted. I haven't slept all night and I need rest before the funeral. Your lawyer...
Person 1: When is the funeral? I'm going to my mother's funeral!
Person 2: There's no point, Rowan. Your coming won't change anything...
Person 1: I will be there! And if you bury my mother before I get there, you'll regret ever meeting me! Is that clear?!",550
"Person 1: Wait, give me a moment to explain...
Person 2: Really? Do you think I don't know what's going on? Someone paid you to seduce me, and it's someone I can't stand. I knew this was all set up!
Person 1: It's not what you think.
Person 2: Oh really? First, you get an advance, and then extra money for being with me?
Person 1: I'm not doing this for the money.",551
"Person 1: Come on, tell me what it's about. You know exactly what I mean.  
Person 2: Honestly, I can't remember. You know I have a poor memory for things like that...",552
"Person 1: You have an interesting way of speaking, it's really intriguing.
Person 2: I used to be an actress.
Person 1: Really? And what do you do now?
Person 2: I study. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
Person 1: You don't look like a student.
Person 2: I'm an independent woman. Really independent.
Person 1: That's not what I meant. You just don't look that young.
Person 2: Because I'm not.
Person 1: So why do you go to college?
Person 2: I have nothing better to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Person 1: And what do you do on other days?
Person 2: I drink.
Person 1: Well, I never!
Person 2: No, not anymore. I'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr...?
Person 1: Eddie. My name is Eddie.
Person 2: That name suits you. And what should I be called?
Person 1: I don't know, whatever you like.
Person 2: I like my name. I'm Sara. It's a biblical name. Do you want to know what it means?
Person 1: Maybe I'll get us a bottle?
Person 2: No.
Person 1: Scotch?
Person 2: Do you want me to end up on the street? Is that it?
Person 1: No, I'll walk you home.",553
"Person 1: Can you answer my question?  
Person 2: Do you realize how long this will take? It's not about a few years... but thousands of years. You will be part of all this. Time will flow, and you will remain here, frozen in time... beautiful forever.  
Person 1: I can't believe we're here alone. There must be someone else...  
Person 2: Let me sculpt you, and then I'll show you where the others are.  
Person 1: That sounds interesting. How do you want to position us?  
Person 2: Naturally, like a couple. Imagine the beauty.  
Person 1: Alright, this could be interesting...",554
"Person 1: I'm leaving. I've had enough of you and all this chaos.
Person 2: Really? Is it that easy for you? Remember Linda Lee in Chiba City. You left her to fend for herself. And now you want to leave me with Molly? Another innocent person you want to put at risk? Maybe you should reconsider your decisions, Mr. Case.",555
"Person 1: Look, a letter from Mr. Zeiss has arrived. He writes that...
Person 2: Why are all the envelopes opened?
Person 1: Oh, you know, I had to open them because they required a quick response, Frances. It's simply a matter of good manners. You shouldn't worry about it.
Person 2: Then why did you bring them to me?
Person 1: It's your fan mail, dear little sister.
Person 2: You disarm me, mom.
Person 1: What do you mean?
Person 2: Well, go on...",556
"Person 1: You know, many people are counting on that ticket. If you give it back, everyone will be happy, and we'll forget about the whole matter.  
Person 2: No way.  
Person 1: Think about what the media will say. Even if you manage to win, you can forget about future contracts. Someone has to take responsibility.  
Person 2: I'm ready to take that responsibility.",557
"Person 1: ""You're playing a dangerous game. If you think you can blackmail me... you're wrong.""

Person 2: ""You know exactly what I want. Don't pretend it's so complicated.""

Person 1: ""Get out of here! Before I call my dad... he trusts you, you're his best friend. This will all be over...""

Person 2: ""And what about you? What will your dad think when he finds out?""

Person 1: ""Stop! I'm telling you, stop! You keep saying that. If it comes out what you did... you'll end up in jail, so you better get out of here before...""

Person 2: ""Before what? What will you do?""",558
"Person 1: Imagine that your friend Betty Finn, who is always so proper and maybe a little plump, is advertising toothpaste. Who would want to buy that toothpaste then?
Person 2: Don't even say it. That toothpaste would be doomed to fail.
Person 1: Exactly, and who would want such a sign of failure on their teeth?",559
"Person 1: And what about the money? I don't know how I'll manage.  
Person 2: Relax, don't worry about it so much.  
Person 1: But I really don't have any savings.  
Person 2: You can use my credit cards, you know that.  
Person 1: I don't feel good about that, it might be illegal.  
Person 2: Oh, stop worrying about it. Who really cares?  
Person 1: I'm afraid I might get into trouble because of it.  
Person 2: Trouble? You already have enough of it. Just do it and stop worrying.",560
"Person 1: That's exactly why I'm here, Mr. Dean. You are a labor lawyer.  
Person 2: That's true.  
Person 1: Last night, Larry Spinks, who works at the steel press, went to a bar with his wife Rosalie to celebrate his birthday. When he went to the bathroom, he was attacked by two men.  
Person 2: I would prefer if we used the term Italian-Americans.  
Person 1: I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. Larry is now in St. Luke's Hospital, so I'm a bit upset. The union bosses say that if we don't accept Bellmoth's offer, the situation will get worse.  
Person 2: That's because your union bosses might be connected to those men.  
Person 1: I don't understand...  
Person 2: The union might be trying to force you to accept worse working conditions.  
Person 1: Why would the union do that?",561
"Person 1: Oh, Selina, it's good that you're here. I was just thinking that I have some interesting proposals that might interest you...
Person 2: Stop, Frank.
Person 1: What do you mean? I'm just suggesting that we could work something out, and you immediately talk about harassment...
Person 2: Can I be honest, Frank? Your whole approach is one big overstep of boundaries. And I know you're not capable of changing that.",562
"Person 1: I am Slovo from the Czech secret police. Here you are under my jurisdiction, and you will do as I say. If you cause any problems, I won't hesitate to shoot you.

Person 2: The same thing again...

Person 1: You are here because your government is pressuring mine. These are our internal affairs, and you are interfering. I warn you only once: do not get involved. Get the information your government is looking for and get out of here.

Person 2: First of all, you should sue whoever sold you that suit. Secondly, I don't want to be here either, so just give it a rest. Thirdly, if you really could shoot me, you would have done it already, so cut the act. Now that we've got that out of the way, I'm going to rest.",563
"Person 1: Listen, put this on under your shirt. When the Tiger ""stabs"" you, fake blood will gush out. The effect will be spectacular! Trust me, it looks better than the real thing.  
Person 2: So I’m supposed to play dead? You’ll grab the gold, and what do I get out of it?  
Person 1: You’ll be able to start a new life in the countryside!  
Person 2: As who? The “Galloping Gladiator” in the countryside?  
Person 1: The point is, you’ll be able to fight in smaller arenas, relax, and live like a king!  
Person 2: Spending days fighting with villagers? I don’t know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I’m starting to feel at home in the Colosseum.  
Person 1: But you have to get out of here! I’ll give you more than a third of the profit! As soon as I get paid... all you have to do is fall over! You’re too “injured” to fight, and that man is a real killer!  
Person 2: Pressure, huh? It must be about big money. Why else would you get rid of someone as valuable as me?  
Person 1: No, it’s not that! It’s for your own good! Come on, put on the rest of the armor!",564
"Person 1: Why did you come to my province?  
Person 2: We were attacked downriver. We need supplies and medical assistance.  
Person 1: You didn't come here to visit me?  
Person 2: No, sir.  
Person 1: You sailed my river in that small boat. So directly. I always thought that ultimate justice would come from the sky, like we used to do. Are you that ultimate justice?  
Person 2: What do you mean, Colonel?  
Person 1: For what other reason could you have come here? Captain. Guardian. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo school. Am I right?  
Person 2: Yes, you are right.",565
"Person 1: Congratulations!  
Person 2: Thanks! It's exciting, isn't it? And where's Jimmy?  
Person 1: He'll be back soon. What would you do if someone gave you a bracelet?  
Person 2: I'd probably thank them!  
Person 1: And what if you found out it was stolen?  
Person 2: Then I wouldn't accept it, of course.  
Person 1: And if you like that person, you'd try to convince them to return the bracelet and start living honestly, right?  
Person 2: Well, yes, but I don't really understand where you're going with this.  
Person 1: Maybe you'll understand if you think about it.",566
"Person 1: Alan, you promised to meet the forecasts. You said it would be a dollar sixty per share. So I guess it shouldn't surprise you that we're meeting.

Person 2: The forecasts were too optimistic.

Person 1: I admit...

Person 2: Our earnings per share were a dollar fifty last quarter. We're eight cents ahead.

Person 1: But we expected ten cents more. In this situation, expectations are key.

Person 2: Do you really want to hold me accountable for those few cents?

Person 1: My shares are losing value. Yours aren't? Those cents are costing me millions.

Person 2: The shares will bounce back.

Person 1: Maybe so. In fact, they almost certainly will rebound over time. Why should I agree to that?

Person 2: Because it's fair. Give me one more quarter. If you still feel that way, you can vote with your shares...

Person 1: You're talking about the future. What matters is the present.

Person 2: You stubborn bastard. If your father could see you now...

Person 1: What?

Person 2: Your father was my friend. Damn... I watched you grow up. How can you treat me like this?",567
"Person 1: Yes, I know.  
Person 2: I love you.

Person 2: Okay, I want you to really listen to me.  
Person 1: For heaven's sake, I'm telling you, I'm listening.  
Person 2: Alright. Vito, you trust Mookie too much. Just like Pop.  
Person 1: Mookie is alright.  
Person 2: Are you really listening to me?  
Person 1: Give me a break, I've already said ten times that I'm listening.  
Person 2: Mookie can't be trusted. No Moulan Yan can be trusted. You just turn your back, and suddenly, boom, a knife in the back.  
Person 1: How do you know that?  
Person 2: I just know.  
Person 1: Do you really think so?  
Person 2: I'm sure. Him, them, they can't be trusted.

"Person 1: Hey, do you have a moment to help me with this project? I really need some support.  
Person 2: Hmm, okay, but why is it so important?  
Person 1: You know, if you help me, I'll be able to better assist our mutual friends with their issue.  
Person 2: I understand. Alright, I'll help you since it's so important.  
Person 1: Great! In that case, I'll handle their issue, but I'll also need something in return.",569
"Person 1: Look at each other and ask yourselves one question: are you really ready to sacrifice your life for a country that has never done anything for you?  
Person 1: Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your life might end here, on this forgotten road.  
Person 1: And I can't guarantee that it will be quick.  
Person 2: Man, Elvis is dead. Maybe you should invest in some CDs instead.",570
"Person 1: Sue called. We have two parties today. One of them is organized by a modeling agency.
Person 2: I'm not sure...
Person 1: Listen, man, there will be really beautiful girls there.
Person 2: Trent, I really don't feel like going out today. I have a ton of things to do tomorrow...
Person 1: Listen, I also have an important audition tomorrow, but I'm going. You need to unwind a bit. You can't just sit at home and keep thinking about her.
Person 2: I don't know...
Person 1: ""I don't know, I don't know"" – listen to yourself. It's going to be great fun. You need to get out of this apartment.
Person 2: We'll spend half the night looking for this party, and then it will turn out to be lame. Then we'll be looking for the other one you heard about. Trent, all these parties and bars are the same. I spend my time there trying to talk to girls who are just looking for someone better to talk to. Am I supposed to be happy because someone has a trendy backpack? Half of them are girls who mean nothing without a bunch of drunk admirers. I don't want to be one of them. It's depressing. Am I supposed to be brushed off by a girl who doesn't hold a candle to my ex? It disgusts me.
Person 1: Man, you really need a change of scenery. Vegas would do you good.
Person 2: What are you talking about? Vegas?
Person 1: Yes, VEGAS.
Person 2: What Vegas?
Person 1: We're going to Vegas.
Person 2: When?
Person 1: Tonight, man.

"Person 1: Hey, did you want to talk?  
Person 2: Where are you actually from? Because you don't look like someone from Alaska. And how is it possible that you dance so well? And what about those stories of starving people?  
Person 1: Why are you so angry with me?  
Person 2: Don't change the subject! I want you to be honest with me and tell me who you really are.  
Person 1: I never lied to you. Maybe I let you believe what you wanted, but I didn't lie.  
Person 2: You think I'm naive, don't you?  
Person 1: Not at all. I really admire you. I fell in love with you at first sight. Really. I think you're amazing...

Person 1: Okay, I'll tell you everything. In 1962...",573
"Person 1: Karl, we need to talk about something that's been bothering me. I'll be direct. Linda and Frank are like family to me, even though my own never was. I had a difficult relationship with my father, but through therapy, I learned that it's not worth wasting energy on hatred. I think you and I are similar, though it might sound strange. It's not about appearance or way of thinking, but about what we've experienced in life. We are perceived as different. You have your... specific traits, and I... well, mine aren't as visible. I'll be straightforward: I'm gay. Does that surprise you?

Person 2: Not really.

Person 1: It means I'm attracted to men.

Person 2: That's not funny, just... strange.

Person 1: That's quite offensive. Did someone teach you that?

Person 2: That's what people say.

Person 1: Living as a gay man in a small town isn't easy. I wanted to leave, but my love for Linda and Frank held me back. Getting to the point, if you're going to live in the Wheatly garage, you need to know that Doyle is a dangerous man. I warned Linda that he might harm her or Frank. I have a good instinct, maybe even intuition. Doyle can make your life difficult. When I saw you, I felt you were sensitive. Frank took you in, like a stray animal. Sorry, that sounded bad. I want you to know what you're in for. You seem like a good person. Maybe it's because Frank might find a friend in you. Sorry if that sounded bad. There's one more thing. It's not my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past. But I see a gentle person in front of me. Just promise me that you'll be able to be close to Linda and Frank. You'd never hurt them, right?

Person 2: I'd never hurt them.

Person 1: I thought so. I hope I didn't offend you. You seem like someone who thinks a lot. Tell me, what are you thinking about now?",574
"Person 1: I can't believe you invited Ryan to the party and didn't even tell me about it.
Person 2: I thought you two had made up a long time ago.
Person 1: Because of that, I had to deal with a lot of awkward situations! Look at what I went through because of you.
Person 2: I'm sorry, Jess. I really thought everything would be okay.

"Person 1: We cannot deal with any matters related to Jerry Fletcher. We are not allowed to talk about him with the press, the New York police, anyone. The building security is to detain him immediately, and we must report any attempt at contact from him.

Person 2: This makes no sense.

Person 1: Not at all. It makes sense. Field operations are not our business.

Person 2: I don't like this. Something doesn't add up.

Person 1: Dr. Jonas anticipated that you might not want to cooperate. Why is that?

Person 2: We don't know who this Jonas is. We don't know who we are supposed to cooperate with.

Person 1: I've seen a lot of documents, Liza. What I saw yesterday taught me not to ask questions. We are out of this. Cut off. End of story. Do you understand?

Person 2: -- I understand.",576
"Person 1: My money is in that office, right?  
Person 2: Yes.  
Person 1: She's trying to convince me that it's not there, that it's somewhere else and we can recover it. If it turns out you're deceiving me, I'll deal with you first. Then I'll try to find out from her where my money really is. If I go in there and that Winston or anyone else gets in my way, you'll bear the consequences. Do you understand what I'm saying?  
Person 2: Yes.  
Person 1: Is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?

Person 1: They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Did you think it was just a game? You're also responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some official, suppressing your talents... Together, as master and apprentice, we can achieve great things.

Person 2: I will never live like a thief!

Person 1: But you already are one.

Person 2: It was just a game. How can I leave? Where will I go?

Person 1: Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone who stands in our way. Even your father.

Person 2: Shut up!

Person 1: This is the life of a Giang Hu warrior... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?

Person 2: I owe you nothing.

Person 1: Oh, but you do! You're still my apprentice.",582
"Person 1: Don't you think it's unfair how much society demands from us regarding fidelity?  
Person 2: You mean not cheating?  
Person 1: Exactly. But what does cheating really mean? Is it just physical infidelity, or does it include thoughts as well?  
Person 2: I understand what you mean.  
Person 1: There can never be anything physical between us. You know that, right, darling?  
Person 2: Yes, I know, Fryderyk.",583

"Person 1: You failed, didn't you? You're a loser.  
Person 2: Stop it already, okay? Think up whatever you want. Write whatever you want, and I'll sign it. Just stop pressuring me all the time! I can't take it! You're acting childish! It's just a game to you, but it's serious for me! Just... leave me alone, okay? You're messing with my head.  
Person 1: Oh. Okay. Calm down. I'm sorry.",586
"Person 1: I wonder if it's bad luck, or if you just don't have luck at work. Or maybe it's something else?
Person 2: Good morning, boss. I'm glad to see you again.

Person 2: Not today, thanks.  
Person 1: What's going on? Why not?  
Person 2: I just don't feel like having dinner and dancing.  
Person 1: But we have some great places in Vancouver. Maybe you'll change your mind?  
Person 2: I'm sure they're nice, but I really don't want to.  
Person 1: How about we drop by a penthouse party around six? A friend of mine is having a cocktail there.  
Person 2: I'm not invited.  
Person 1: At Clark Brandon's, you don't need invitations. Everyone just shows up.  
Person 2: Maybe I should clarify something, Mr. Mitchell. You've been nice to me in a few situations, and I appreciate it, but that doesn't mean you can control me.  
Person 1: If I were to control anyone, it would only be you.",588

"Person 1: You know, something's been bothering me. How is it that you know the way to the bedroom so well?

Person 2: What? What are you talking about?

Person 1: This morning, when I caught you with Grace, you swore you hadn't even gone near the bedroom. And now I see you heading there like you own the place.

Person 2: Come on, Jake...

Person 1: Don't try to brush me off! It's a big house. It's strange that you know the way so well unless you've been here before. Maybe with Grace as your companion.

Person 2: Nothing happened between me and Grace this morning.

Person 1: Maybe in the afternoon then. I sent you to take care of business in the wasteland, and instead, you seduced my wife.

Person 2: Jake, please...

Person 1: So how was it? Did you even make it to the wasteland, or did you spend the afternoon in my bed?

Person 2: You're not making sense.

Person 1: Sense? If I had any sense, I would have dealt with you this morning, and that would be the end of it.

Person 2: What are you... you can't kill me.

Person 1: A drifter, a loner, an adventurer like you? You pass through town, need money, so you break into an old man's house. Only this old man has a gun and knows how to use it. A man must protect his home. His wife. You're dead, boy, and even your mother wouldn't convict me.

Person 2: What difference does it make if I slept with her? You don't care about Grace.

Person 1: You're right. I don't care. But betrayal of trust? That makes a man a fool. I don't like being made a fool of.

Person 2: I don't blame you. What man would agree to that? I admit it, okay? I came back here and was with Grace. But if you kill me, you'll be making a big mistake.

Person 1: From my point of view, no.

Person 2: It's not me you should be afraid of. It's her. She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and wants your money.

Person 1: What are you babbling about?

Person 2: Think about it. How do you think I got in here? Did you hear glass break? Did you hear the door fall apart? How did the evening end? After you went to bed, did she stay a little longer? Maybe just long enough to leave the back door open? Did that happen?",591
"Person 1: Hey, I need to take care of a few things in San Diego. What do you say we go there together for a few days? It will really be great!
Person 2: No, Harry, I really can't...
Person 1: Come on, it will be fun! I need some company, and besides, you could use a little break. You're coming, right?",592
"Person 1: It looks like you're imprisoning her, Taransky. Are you some kind of Svengali?  
Person 2: And who is really the prisoner here, Sayer? You look ""enslaved."" While you're obsessively thinking about Simone, she doesn't even know you exist. Leave my property, or I'll call the police.  
Person 1: The police? They read my articles to know who to chase. We are the only guardians of society. None of this will disappear. We'll be here tomorrow and the day after. Until you make a mistake. And you will. You live in your own shadow. All these complicated precautions regarding Simone—every instinct tells me it's unnatural.  
Person 2: I'm just trying to help, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed. It gets cold here at night.  
Person 1: Nice joke. If we can't reach her through you, maybe your family will be more willing to cooperate. I can guarantee you, Taransky, that one way or another, Miss Simone and I will meet.  
Person 2: I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.",593
"Person 1: I don't agree with that guy driving you around.  
Person 2: Maybe if you didn't make a scene every time I danced on the pole, you'd do it yourself. I have to support our daughter somehow.  
Person 1: Max is doing this on purpose. He assigned you to him to annoy me.  
Person 2: Ho is a good man...  
Person 1: Ho is a pimp! He's encouraging Wendy to prostitute herself, and that's his own wife!  
Person 2: Quiet, or he'll hear you.  
Person 1: Good! Maybe it'll save me from repeating myself. I don't want him driving you around!  
Person 2: Listen, Bobby. This is my job. Thanks to it, we have a roof over our heads — me, our daughter, and you, if you want to be here.  
Person 1: I want you to quit.  
Person 2: Look at the bills. I can't afford to. I won't let our daughter go through what I did.  
Person 1: I can support you.  
Person 2: And with what, exactly?  
Person 1: Max said he'd help me.  
Person 2: Yeah, Max says a lot. I've got news for you: he's not the nice old man you think he is.",594
"Person 1: I asked you something.
Person 2: But, Toby, really nothing happened. We were just talking.
Person 1: Stop talking and get back to our table. And you, buddy, don't make me repeat the question. What were you up to with my girlfriend?",595
"Person 1: We can't go back there. Do you really think it's a good idea? You saw what was happening there...
Person 2: But it's our only chance. Think about what it would be like if your father were still there. Do you really want to give up the possibility of finding him?",596
"Person 1: Pat, calm down, don't do anything rash. Do you really want people to think that you have no self-control?
Person 2: And who are you to say such things about me? Are you trying to slander me?",597
"Person 1: Do you think he understood what I was saying to him?  
Person 2: What are you doing? He's a decent man. You can't treat him like that. He might report it to the FBI.  
Person 1: I don't care about the FBI! This guy has been avoiding me for three weeks. And you? Suddenly you're telling me what to do?  
Person 2: I don't want to tell you what to do, but you went too far, Nick. What's going on with you? Where's your head?  
Person 1: Where's my head? And where's your courage? You know I'm trying to organize something really big. You know what I mean, right? If you're acting like this now, how can I rely on you? A lot is going to change. And if you want to be with me, Sammy, you have to follow my path.  
Person 2: Listen, Nick, you need to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I have a hundred million a year going through this business. It's all going to end, I'm telling you, it will end if I don't get that license. And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it will for many people too.  
Person 1: Forget about your license. When I plant my flag here, you won't need it. I don't know what's happening, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel you just don't want to cooperate with me, is that it?  
Person 2: No, I don't want to go with you...  
Person 1: Say it straight.  
Person 2: I don't want to go with you.  
Person 1: Just say it.  
Person 2: I'll be honest with you.
